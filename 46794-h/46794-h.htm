<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">My dear Boys</span>:&mdash;As doubtless you well know,
the early pioneer days were times that tried
men's souls. And boys, hardly in their teens,
were taught, in the bitter school of experience,
that they must always live up to the old Puritan
motto, "Trust in the Lord; but <i>keep your
powder dry</i>." These same lads early learned
to be self-dependent, and to fight their own
battles.</p>

<p>Steeped in this atmosphere, the names of
many heroic early settlers have come down to
us through the pages of history. We all delight
to read of their bold achievements, for
they were men of whom the country must ever
be proud.</p>

<p>But those stirring times before the Revolution
also gave birth to many a valiant soul
whose daring and sacrifices have never been
recorded on the scroll of Fame. Some of these
heroes were mere striplings in point of years,
yet capable, in times of great stress, of proving
themselves "chips of the old block."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span></p>

<p>It is to record the intensely interesting adventures
of several of these young pioneers,
whose axes helped to blaze the way of civilization
in the then unknown region beyond the
Alleghanies, that I have started to write this
series of books. I sincerely trust that if you
enjoy reading the present and first volume,
you will welcome the story to follow, to be
called: "The Pioneer Boys on the Great
Lakes; or, On the Trail of the Iroquois."</p>

jerked venison." (<a href="#Note_1">Note 1.</a>)<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>Robert Armstrong, sixteen years of age,
looked down upon the ground where the trail
of the deer was well defined, and evidently he,
too, felt some of the eagerness that possessed
his more impulsive brother.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>
<p>It was the days previous to the Revolution.
Around the two youths stretched the great
primeval Virginia wilderness, sparsely settled,
and hedged in by the chain of Alleghany Mountains,
beyond which only a few venturesome
spirits had ever dared journey; and some of
these bold pioneers had never come back to tell
the tale of their discoveries and exploits.</p>

<p>The two boys had started from their cabin
home, just outside a small Virginia town, determined
to secure fresh food for the family,
at that time facing unusual privation.</p>

<p>Alexander, or Sandy, as he was always
called, the impetuous one, seldom looked any
distance ahead, so that it was Robert who
many times found himself compelled to pull
his younger brother out of serious difficulties.</p>

<p>Still, both lads, having been born and reared
on the Virginia frontier, were really older
through experience than their years would indicate.</p>

<p>In those strenuous days of pioneering, boys
had to learn how to take care of themselves
very soon after they began to walk. Their
daily life brought them in touch with the perils
of the wilderness. They were taught how to
handle a gun at five years of age, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
tracks made by all wild animals soon became as
plain to them as the pages of a printed book
to a scholar.</p>

<p>Sandy, seeing his more cautious brother
hesitate, renewed his pleading.</p>

<p>"We need this deer very much, Bob," he
went on, eagerly. "Since father lost his place
with old Jason Diggett, things have gone hard
with us at home. Mother tries to smile and
cheer us up, but every door has been shut
against poor father since that tobacco barn
burned down, and he was accused of setting
fire to it."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the other, a frown crossing his
young face as though painful memories had
been stirred up by his brother's words, "but
they were not able to prove anything against
father, and we know that he could never have
done such a thing."</p>

<p>"But the deer," continued Sandy, persistently;
"why not try for it? Perhaps it may
be feeding close by, in some glade where the
trees have sheltered the grass, or where there
are tender twigs to be nipped off. Say yes,
Bob, and let us start right away."</p>

<p>The older boy cast a quick look upward, and
his gaze rested longest in the quarter where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
the forest wall was broken, allowing a view of
the gray sky.</p>

<p>"The air is raw, and I'm sure a storm is
coming, late though the season is," he remarked,
slowly.</p>

<p>"Well, what of that?" declared Sandy, impatiently.
"We are neither sugar nor salt,
to be washed away by rain or snow. Just think
how mother would smile if she saw us carrying
home a nice fat buck, or even a doe? Bob, say
yes! This chance is too good to be lost."</p>

<p>Apparently his argument carried the day.
That last stroke swept the more cautious Robert
quite off his feet, for he loved his dear
little mother above all things on earth, and the
thought of pleasing her made him ignore his
inner warnings.</p>

<p>"All right, then, Sandy; let's call it a go.
Just to be able to carry home a store of fresh
meat we'll take chances. And now to follow
the tracks."</p>

<p>With that he bent his keen gaze upon the
ground, and immediately started along the
trail left by the deer, Sandy following close at
his heels.</p>

<p>Both lads carried the old-time flint-lock muskets,
such as were in general use during those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
early days. They served their purpose fairly
well, especially when in the steady hands of
those who knew life often depended on accuracy
of aim. Many woodrangers and trappers,
however, had guns with longer barrels, which
they called rifles, and capable of sending a
patched bullet with unerring skill a great distance.</p>

<p>In and out among the trees the two boys
moved along. Not a single word passed between
them until at least a mile had been covered.
Then Sandy could restrain his impatience
no longer. It was always a difficult
thing to keep him "bottled up" when speech
was concerned, and his brother Bob often declared
he would make a good lawyer, or a
parson, he liked to hear himself talk so much.</p>

<p>"Are we getting closer, Bob? Is the trail
any fresher than before? Oh! I thought I saw
something move just then!" he whispered in
the other's ear.</p>

<p>"Where?" demanded Bob, instantly, as he
turned his head around, a look of concern on
his face; for, while the Indians of Virginia
gave little trouble to the settlers at that day,
they were not always to be trusted.</p>

<p>"Never mind," returned Sandy, with a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
chuckle; "for I see now it was only a poor,
scared rabbit bounding away. But how about
the deer, brother?"</p>

<p>"We must be near him," said Bob, gravely;
"and I believe he will turn out to be a five-prong
buck, to judge from the size of his hoofs.
Silence, now, and we will go on. Remember to
keep a close watch ahead, and, if you get a
good sight, send your lead back of his foreleg
sure."</p>

<p>"You can depend on me, Bob," replied the
younger lad; and it was not boastfulness that
made him say this, for he had long since developed
into a remarkably clever marksman.</p>

<p>In the fall, when the first snows drifted
down through the valleys of Virginia, the settlers
always held shooting matches, where the
best shots of the country competed for prizes,
usually some wild turkeys that had been trapped
alive. And more than a few times Sandy had
held his own with the celebrated sharpshooters
among the buckskin-clad hunters from the
trails. No eye was quicker than his to glance
along the shiny barrel of a musket; and when
he pulled the trigger his lead usually found
its mark, even though the target were but the
ever moving head of a turkey, whose body was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
hidden in the ground, fully an hundred yards
distant from the marksman.</p>

<p>Once more the two boys pushed on. Before
five minutes passed Bob noticed something that
gave him a little concern. He had caught sight
of the first snowflake that came scurrying
along on the wings of the rising wind. A little
thing in itself, but which might mean a tremendous
lot to these boys, miles away from
home, and surrounded by a trackless forest.
In another five minutes, just as he had feared,
the snow was beginning to descend heavily, so
that his task of following the trail of the deer
promised to come to a speedy end, as the
ground began to be covered with a white mantle.</p>

<p>There was only one thing that could be done
now, if they meant to pursue the hunt any further.
Bob of late had been noting the general
direction taken by the deer; and they
could keep pushing on, each pair of eyes on
the alert for signs of the expected quarry.</p>

<p>Now it became necessary to bring to the fore
all the knowledge of woodcraft the boys possessed.
They must judge at a glance just how
a deer would proceed while pushing through
the forest, avoiding such dense thickets as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
promised to entangle his antlers, and at the
same time seeking shelter from possible enemies.</p>

<p>Suddenly Bob came to a stop, and whispered:</p>

<p>"Look ahead to where that pawpaw jungle
ends! Something moved there; and blest if
I don't think it must be our game!"</p>

<p>Even as he finished speaking, out of the
screening hedge leaped a gallant buck, his head
thrown back, and every muscle in his frame
answering to his fear of human kind.</p>

<p>It was a pretty sight, and one calculated to
make the blood bound more quickly through
the veins of a hunter; but neither of the boys
delayed even one second in order to admire the
scene. Their one thought was of the possibility
of their eagerly anticipated supply of meat
making off on its own rapidly flying hoofs.</p>

<p>Sandy was a bit the quicker in firing, for,
being nervous by nature, he knew how to aim
more by instinct than by going through a set
habit. Still, the two discharges seemed to roll
into one; and, with their hearts in their
mouths, the young marksmen looked to ascertain
what the result of the shots might be.</p>

<p>"Huzza! he is down!" almost shrieked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Sandy, as the big buck made a tremendous
bound into the air, and came crashing upon the
snow-covered earth, where he tried in vain to
regain his feet.</p>

<p>"Stop! Remember what old Reuben told
you always to do!" cautioned Bob, as he
thrust himself in front of Sandy, already in the
act of leaping forward.</p>

<p>"I forgot," murmured the other, as with
trembling hand he started to reload his gun,
some of the powder from his horn slipping out
of his shaking fingers as he attempted to pour
it into the muzzle of the barrel.</p>

<p>Then came a greased bullet in a patch of
linen, being pushed down after the powder had
been rammed good and hard. To prime the
flint-lock gun was no great difficulty, though
constant vigilance was needed in order to make
sure that the priming, so essential to a discharge,
be not shaken from the pan by accident.</p>

<p>"Now let us go up," said Sandy, after both
had reloaded.</p>

<p>"He's kicking his last," remarked his
brother, quietly, "and there is no fear of our
losing him. I wonder now if I missed. You
were, as usual, ahead of me in firing, Sandy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
And I saw him quiver even before I pulled
trigger, so I know you hit him."</p>

<p>When they bent over the now motionless
quarry it was found that there were <i>two</i> bullet-holes
in the deer. (<a href="#Note_2">Note 2.</a>)</p>

<p>"Yours is the one behind the shoulder,
Sandy, and that killed him instantly. He could
have run a mile or more with the wound
through the body that I gave him. But never
mind, we have had great luck, and mother
will be pleased when we carry this meat
home."</p>

<p>Bob lost no time in bleeding the game. They
were so far away from the cabin that it would
be impossible to "tote" the deer there intact;
so it was quickly determined to cut up the
venison and select the choice portions.</p>

<p>Both boys carried hunting knives, and they
set to work without delay. As they labored
they became so interested in what they were
doing that neither seemed to pay any particular
attention to the remarkable change that
had come over the weather, until after a while
Sandy started to complain that it was getting
so dark he could hardly see how to
work.</p>

<p>Then an exclamation from his brother caused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
him to raise his head. What he saw was anything
but reassuring. The snow was coming
down between the trees in blinding sheets,
driven before a cold wind, that seemed to be
growing stronger with every passing minute.</p>

<p>"No getting back to the cabin for us to-night,
Sandy," declared the older one, with a
shake of his head. "This promises to be as
bad a storm as we've had all winter, and even
at the shortest you know we'd have a five-hour
tramp back home. So we must make the
best of a bad bargain and camp here in the
woods."</p>

<p>"Well," remarked Sandy, whom no danger
ever daunted, "anyhow, we've got plenty to
eat, and can keep warm, unless both of us forgot
to bring flint and steel along, which I know
is not so, for here are mine in my pouch, and
some dry tinder as well."</p>

<p>By the time they had finished the task of
cutting up the deer, and secured all the choice
portions in the skin, the forest was swathed in
a mantle of white; and, on the wind that
screeched so noisily while hurrying past, came
new armies of scurrying snowflakes that beat
against the faces of the lads until they fairly
stung with the pain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Evidently the young pioneers were in for
an experience besides which all previous encounters
with snow-storms would pale into
utter insignificance.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

<small>THE CABIN IN THE CLEARING</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">David Armstrong</span>, the father of the two
young hunters, was descended from a fine old
Scotch family. At the death of his father he
inherited a considerable estate, but the loss of
his parent made the thought of remaining in
the old home too painful to him, and he decided
to leave Scotland and seek a new home. He
consequently sold everything he possessed and,
with his young wife and little children, sailed
for the new country beyond the sea, and settled
at Richmond, where he engaged in the tobacco
business.</p>

<p>For some years he prospered, but trouble
finally overtook him. A relative, whom he had
taken into partnership, betrayed his confidence,
with the result that one day David awoke to
find that he had the experience, while this
cousin possessed the money that had been invested.</p>

<p>Even in those primitive days there were
courts where those who believed they had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
wronged could seek redress, and David would
have failed to do credit to his Scotch ancestry
had he not been a fighter. He believed he had
a good case against this relative who had
swindled him, and he tried to press the matter.</p>

<p>But, somewhat discouraged by the constant
delays, he made up his mind at last to leave
for a point further west, and begin life anew
under more humble conditions.</p>

<p>He had come westward from the region
around Richmond, and settled near a small
town, where he secured employment at the tobacco
warehouse of a certain Jason Diggett,
the richest man in that region. He did his
work faithfully as the days and months went
by, seldom complaining, so long as he had his
dearly beloved wife, and his three children to
comfort him; yet never ceasing to hope that he
would hear good news from Richmond, and
receive his own again from the clever relative
who had tricked him.</p>

<p>He was anxious to do all he could for his
three children, Kate, Robert and Alexander;
and sent them regularly to the little schoolhouse,
where they learned the rudiments of
reading and figuring, which among many persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
in those days were considered all the education
required to carry one through life.</p>

<p>The family spent some very happy years in
the little cabin that stood in a clearing. The
boys knew nearly every one in the town; and
as they grew older began to show themselves
capable of assisting in the task of supporting
the family. Often they brought in game from
the forest, and in the season their traps yielded
them quite a little harvest in the pelts of otter,
muskrat, mink, fox, badger and wildcat.</p>

<p>Suddenly, like a bolt out of the blue sky,
trouble swooped down upon the Armstrongs.
David had some difficulty with his employer,
and was discharged, since he was too proud
to seek a reconciliation, when he fully believed
himself to be in the right.</p>

<p>Then, one night, the tobacco barn of Jason
Diggett burned to the ground, entailing quite
a loss. Suspicion alighted on David, simply
because it was known that between the two men
ill feelings existed.</p>

<p>So David was arrested, and held in the town
blockhouse for a whole week; but, there being
no actual proof against him, he was allowed to
go free. That had been more than a month
before, and, ever since, most of the people who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
had once called themselves his friends had
turned their heads aside when by chance they
met. The odor of guilt clung to his skirts, for,
even though the law had declared it had no
evidence upon which to base conviction, people
<i>believed</i> he must be guilty, since some one
had surely set fire to the barn, and who besides
David had any grudge against Jason Diggett?</p>

<p>Armstrong fretted greatly over the injustice
of such action, and it took all the tact of his
wife, Mary, to keep him from doing some rash
act.</p>

<p>"If this keeps up much longer, wife," he
would say, after a fresh exhibition of coldness
and aloofness on the part of those who had
once called him friend, "we must leave here
for good, and go further into the wilderness.
It is useless for me to look further for work,
since no one wishes to employ a <i>barn-burner!</i>"</p>

<p>His loving wife would labor to cheer him
up as only a loyal woman could. Possessed of
a sunny disposition, trusting by nature, and
above all imbued with a strong sense of God's
goodness, Mary Armstrong refused to lose
heart.</p>

<p>"It will surely come out all right, husband,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
she would say, as her loving hands smoothed
the frown away from his forehead; "we must
have patience, and do our part. To-morrow,
perhaps the day after; but in His good time
it will all be well."</p>

<p>And, although David had vowed he would
not again seek work in that bitter community,
when another day arrived, her sweet influence
over him was so great that once more he would
stalk forth, moodily, but with his spirit still
uncrushed.</p>

<p>It was a momentous time in the history of
the colonies. For many months there had been
heard mutterings of the storm that was later
to break at Lexington and Bunker Hill. Already
people were taking sides, even in the
more distant settlements, and were either patriots
or loyalists, according to the way they
looked at things.</p>

<p>But David Armstrong gave little thought to
such matters, for his own troubles were so
exceedingly weighty that he could think of
little else.</p>

<p>There was much talk of daring pioneers
journeying still further into that wonderful
country beyond the great mountains; and
again and again did he brood over the possibilities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
that might await the forerunners of
civilization there.</p>

<p>Those who had made the trip, and returned,
gave such glowing descriptions of the amazing
fertility of the black soil, and the astounding
number of game animals to be had for the mere
shooting, that it was small wonder the harassed
borderer's mind turned westward many
times, and he was only waiting for some climax
to arrive ere packing up and moving
toward the land of the setting sun.</p>

<p>On the very morning that the two boys
started out on their memorable hunt for fresh
venison, David had taken new courage, and
once more ventured to look for work.</p>

<p>"The very last time, wife, mark you," he
had solemnly declared as he kissed her good-bye,
and she knew that finally he had indeed
reached the parting of the ways; for, if his
quest was now in vain, he would never ask a
favor of these town people again.</p>

<p>During the month when David had been idle,
and the one that followed his release from the
blockhouse strong-room, it can be understood
that things were at low ebb in the home of the
Armstrongs.</p>

<p>At no time had they been able to accumulate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
any amount ahead of their constant needs; so
that very soon they hardly knew where to turn
for money with which to purchase the few
necessities of life.</p>

<p>Robert and Sandy sold what few skins they
had collected; then they busied themselves
hunting, and trying to trap more animals; but
the winter had been unusually severe, and trappers
reported a scarcity of pelts.</p>

<p>Recently even little Kate, just fourteen, had
hired out to a neighboring family, as the
daughters of the pioneers often did, without
losing any of their self-respect, or standing.</p>

<p>Mrs. Armstrong worked at her various tasks
as the day advanced. Noon came and went,
and the sky clouded up with evil portents of
snow, for the air was raw and had all the ominous
attributes which these woods-dwellers
knew presaged a storm.</p>

<p>Frequently she would step outside the humble
log cabin to look around, and see whether
either the boys or her husband could be coming.
Then her troubled eyes would scan the
bleak heavens, and note that already the first
flakes of snow, forerunners of the mighty
storm to come, were drifting along on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
rising wind that was moaning through the sentinel
oak at the back of the cabin.</p>

<p>She wished the boys were safe at home,
though she was so confident of their ability to
take care of themselves, no matter under what
difficulties, that she did not as yet once allow
herself to fear actual danger to them.</p>

<p>They had all their lives been accustomed to
roaming the woods, and knew how to grapple
with such emergencies as hunters may expect
to meet.</p>

<p>The afternoon had begun to decline, and the
snow was coming down heavily, when David
arrived home. Little need for his wife to look
twice to understand what his dejected manner
indicated.</p>

<p>"It's no use, wife," he said, moodily, a
frown on his strong face; "everything's working
against me here, and I doubt if I have a
single real friend in all the community. The
poison has done its work, and there is no employment
here for a man suspected of being a
barn-burner. I've been turned away by a man
I believed would take my word as quick as my
bond. And I tell you I'm done. Never again
will I demean myself asking favors on my
knees, just because my family may be in need."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>And wise Mary Armstrong, realizing that
the strong man had indeed gone to the limit
of his strength, knew that there must come
a change. It were folly to continue to beat
one's head against the wall. Better find some
way of less resistance, and allow the current
to carry them on.</p>

<p>"We have each other, David," she said,
sturdily, as became a pioneer wife and
mother; "and as long as health remains we
must not complain. See, I give in entirely to
you. Let us leave here at the very first chance,
and in a new country try to secure contentment,
even though we may not find happiness
as long as this cloud hangs over your head.
Cheer up! With three fine children, and a
husband whom I respect and love, I am content.
The darkest cloud has a silver lining.
Wait, and hope!"</p>

<p>"Then you consent that we shall emigrate
to the land beyond the mountains, to the banks
of that beautiful stream they call the Ohio, of
which we have heard so much?"</p>

<p>It had been a vague dream with David for
some time, and the prospect of being able to
carry it into actual execution in the near future
began to arouse him; so that he threw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
off his moody spirits, and showed rising animation.</p>

<p>"Yes, anything that you think wise," Mary
went on calmly, though her heart was sore, "I
am ready to undertake. But, of course, we
could not think of starting until some caravan
arrives here in the spring, headed that way.
You were telling of one that was expected."</p>

<p>"Yes," said David, eagerly, "the last time
Pat O'Mara, the trapper, was here, he was
speaking of that famous hunter, Daniel Boone,
and how he had organized an expedition in
Carolina that was to pass up along this way
in the spring, headed for the mountain passes
and the bank of the great Ohio. We must be
ready to throw our poor fortunes in with them
when they reach here. I only hope and pray
that new friends may be more merciful than
old ones."</p>

<p>"I wish the boys were safe at home, for it
promises to be a hard storm, from the looks of
things," said the fond mother, anxiously.</p>

<p>David's eyes sparkled with a look of pride
in his offspring.</p>

<p>"Fear nothing for those two lads. To Robert
the secrets of the woods are as an open
book; and I would trust them to even go over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the great mountain trail alone. They have
their guns, and will know how to protect themselves
from the storm. In due time we shall
see them again, Heaven willing."</p>

<p>It was his turn now to comfort, a new role
for David Armstrong; but he knew, better than
did his wife, how those half-grown boys had
become familiar with the perils of the wilderness,
and understood how to meet them almost
as well as the oldest and most experienced
forest ranger.</p>

<p>The day gradually came to a close, and when
evening had drawn near, so that the kettle was
singing over the flames, and supper cooking,
Mary Armstrong went often to the door to
peer out into the howling storm, as if still
hoping that her brave boys would show up,
like white ghosts, to join them at the humble
and scanty repast.</p>

<p>But presently the time came when she and
her husband had to sit down to the board alone,
for no cheery hail came out of the gloomy
night; but even then the mother would not let
David see how worried she felt. She insisted
upon talking about the Promised Land beyond
the mountain chain, and asked him scores of
questions concerning it, so that he could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
dream how her mother heart felt cold with
new-born fears, and how her ears were ever
attuned to the wild music of the raging storm,
in which, <i>somewhere</i>, far away, she realized
her two boys must be caught.</p>

<p>Later grew the hour. David had brought in
a goodly supply of firewood, for so long as they
could wield an axe there was always a bountiful
amount of this at their very door, to be had
for the cutting. Then they prepared to retire
for the night, the settler in a better humor than
he had been exhibiting for weeks; for at last
he began to see a way out of the terrible difficulty
that had so long been confronting them.</p>

<p>And while he slept, and dreamed of that
wonderful land of plenty along the border of
the Ohio River, Mary lay awake, her gentle
heart filled with unspoken prayers concerning
the safety of their boys.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

<small>CAUGHT IN THE SNOW-STORM</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">What</span> makes it so dark, Bob?" asked the
younger brother, as they finished tying up the
best part of the venison in the skin which had
been removed from the deer.</p>

<p>"Night is coming on ahead of time, and I
reckon it will be one we'll not forget in a hurry,
either," replied the other, calmly; for Robert
seldom gave way to excitement, leaving that
to Sandy.</p>

<p>"Then the sooner we find some place for a
camp the better," remarked the latter. "The
wind keeps growing colder all the while, and
it bites like a knife when it drives the hail
against your face. Do you know, I think I
heard a wolf howl a little while ago?"</p>

<p>"That would hardly be surprising," was
Bob's reply as he shouldered the meat wrapped
up in the deerskin, leaving to his brother the
two muskets and the small game. "It was
only a few days ago that Amiel Teene had an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
adventure with the pests not ten miles away
from his cabin."</p>

<p>"Yes, and he said he had never seen them
so savage," declared Sandy, glancing around
at the snowy forest, as if in imagination he
could already see a host of gaunt gray forms
leaping toward them.</p>

<p>"The winter has been unusually long and
hard, and, as we happen to know, Sandy, game
has been scarce. Perhaps it was so up in the
mountains, and the animals have been pushed
to venture nearer the settlements than at most
times. This storm will make them even
worse."</p>

<p>"Then, if we should meet a pack to-night,
the scent of this fresh meat would make them
crazy to get at us," said Sandy, reflectively,
as he fell in alongside his brother.</p>

<p>"Yes, I can easily believe it," grunted the
larger youth, who had quite a load on his back,
and could afford just then to expend little of
his wind in conversation.</p>

<p>"And perhaps we might have to take to a
tree, just as I did two years ago, waiting for
dawn to drive the critters away; eh, Bob?"</p>

<p>"Not on such a night as this, brother," remarked
the one addressed. "You forget that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
it was not bitter cold weather when you met
with your little experience. To-night, if we
climbed into a tree, we might freeze to death
before morning."</p>

<p>"Then what can we do? I am sure I heard
a far-off howl again just then; and perhaps
those sharp-nosed rascals have already scented
a dinner," and Sandy pushed a little closer to
his companion, deeply stirred.</p>

<p>It was no imaginary peril that hung over
their heads. A single wolf might play the part
of a coward, and shrink from mankind; but
when gathered in a pack the beasts became an
object of dread to every settler on the border.
More than one man, in the history of Virginia,
had been dragged down by starving wolves;
and of all times of the year the end of a hard
winter was the worst.</p>

<p>"I had thought of that, Sandy," the elder
brother went on; "and remembered that, just
before we sighted the deer, I had seen a place
that offered us a refuge. It is toward that
point I am now trying to lead the way. Keep
your eyes open for a fallen tree. I think we
must be near the spot right now."</p>

<p>"And there it is," announced Sandy, joyfully,
as he pointed ahead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>They were in fact right upon it, though the
sifting, driving snow had, up to that moment,
hidden from their eager eyes all signs of the
wished-for goal.</p>

<p>And when Sandy saw what a fortress was
afforded them by the hole in the ground, where
the roots of the tree had once grown, he was
ready to throw up his cap and shout with satisfaction.</p>

<p>At some time in the remote past a great wind
storm had evidently uprooted this forest monarch;
but, in falling, it had not quite lain flat,
so that, twenty feet from the roots, one might
even walk underneath the trunk.</p>

<p>A great cavity had been torn in the earth,
and, as it happened that the upturned roots
and the trunk were toward the storm, the barrier
would afford a fine shelter against its
biting force.</p>

<p>There, in the opening left by the uprooting
of the great tree, they could make themselves
fairly comfortable. Sandy even saw possibilities
for fortifying themselves within the hole,
so that they might defy an attack on the part
of the fiercest pack of wolves that ever roamed
through those woods.</p>

<p>The boys immediately set to work with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
vim. They had travelled many miles during
the progress of the hunt, and it might reasonably
be expected that both would be tired; but
one would never dream of such a thing, judging
from the vigor with which they hewed firewood,
and proceeded to arrange their novel
camp.</p>

<p>Accustomed to roughing it from early childhood,
Bob and his brother asked but little in
order to find a reasonable degree of comfort.
Given a fire and a warm bite to eat, they envied
not a king his crown. And, if the bite were
lacking, why, the fire was not to be sneezed
at. In those early days boys knew nothing of
luxuries.</p>

<p>While Sandy labored with the heavy camp
hatchet, the elder brother began to get the fire
underway, for long practice had made him an
expert with flint and steel. Some small sticks
were heaped up in a loose manner, and a bit
of dry tinder shoved under it; then, with several
deft strokes of the steel, sparks were sent
into its inflammable heart, and a tiny blaze
sprang up, which was fostered until it had
seized upon the larger wood.</p>

<p>Things began to look much more comfortable
to the young pioneers after that fire shed its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
ruddy glow upon their camp. And when Bob
had sliced several fair portions of the fresh
venison, and had thrust them near the fire on
the ends of long splinters of wood, the odor
that presently began to arise made Sandy sniff
the air, and try to restrain his voracious appetite.</p>

<p>They had nothing to drink with the meal.
Tea was worth too much at that time for boys
to carry any of the precious stuff off on their
tramps; and as for coffee, it was an almost
unknown beverage with the colonists.</p>

<p>After all, as the famous Daniel Boone was
often heard to declare, it was astonishing what
few actual necessities primitive man must have
in order to keep him in fighting trim. And
Boone patterned his life after the redmen of
that country beyond the mountain chain, of
whom he probably knew more than any living
border man of the day.</p>

<p>"This is fine," observed Sandy, a little later.</p>

<p>They were sitting close to the fire and devouring
their roast venison with infinite gusto.
No doubt the pampered boy of to-day might
hardly have relished the rude fare; but these
pioneer lads were made of different stuff, and
thankful for exceedingly small things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," replied Bob quietly; "but we must
get to work quickly, and add to the pile of firewood,
as well as barricade the open side of the
hole."</p>

<p>"Did you hear it, too?" demanded his
brother, instantly.</p>

<p>"Yes, and more than one wolf answered the
long howl. They are sending signals across
the forest. I think we will have visitors before
the night is over."</p>

<p>Sandy hurried through the remainder of his
primitive supper, almost bolting the last few
morsels. Then he once more started to make
good use of the sharp hatchet. While he
worked after this fashion his brother began to
search for objects with which to fill up the gap
to leeward as much as possible.</p>

<p>"Good!" Sandy presently heard him exclaim
from the midst of the blinding snow close
by. "Here lie several old logs. This way,
and give me a hand. They will make a grand
fort."</p>

<p>It required considerable effort to drag the
half-rotted logs into position; but where there
is a will there is nearly always a way, and in
the end the object of their desires was accomplished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>"Could hardly be much better, I take it,"
was Sandy's enthusiastic comment, as he stood
back and surveyed the result of their labors.</p>

<p>"No, and I wager it would be a pretty rash
wolf that would dare try to leap that barrier,"
remarked his brother, now taking a turn with
the hatchet, as the size of the pile of fuel did
not altogether please him, with a long night
ahead and that bitter wind rushing through the
woods.</p>

<p>Finally both were too wearied to attempt
anything more, so they sat down alongside the
cheery blaze, to rest ere trying to sleep. One
might think it rather a hazardous thing to lose
themselves in slumber without any covering;
but they knew many of the tricks of the pioneers
of the day, and that, if they kept their
feet warm, all would be well. Besides, both
boys had been warmly clad when starting forth
on their search for game, for they had an industrious
mother, whose spinning-wheel seldom
knew a day's rest. (<a href="#Note_3">Note 3.</a>)</p>

<p>It was decided that a watch must be kept,
since they were surrounded by so many perils.
If the fire went out they might have a foot or
hand frozen, and the absence of the blaze must
encourage the forest howlers to make an attack,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
eager to secure a share of that fresh
venison.</p>

<p>Bob had placed the meat, again wrapped up
in the skin, as far back as possible under the
matted roots of the fallen monarch of the forest.
Both boys were grimly determined that
they would fight desperately to retain possession
of their prize, since that store of food
meant much to the dear ones back at the humble
cabin home.</p>

<p>"What are you thinking about, Bob?"
asked Sandy, as he watched the play of the
fire across his brother's resolute face, and
noted the expression, almost wistful, that came
upon it at times.</p>

<p>"It was about father," he replied, speaking
the word tenderly, for David Armstrong had
ever been a kind and affectionate parent, and
was fairly worshipped by his little flock.</p>

<p>"Yes, I knew that was it," said Sandy,
quickly. "Oh! I do hope he has been successful
in finding work to-day, for he declared it
would be the last time he would try. What
do you suppose we can do if he fails, Bob?"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 338px;">
<img src="images/i047.jpg" width="338" height="500" alt="wolves in shadow" />
<div class="caption">"DISCOVERED A HALF CIRCLE OF GLEAMING YELLOW EYES WATCHING HIM."</div>
</div>

<p>"There is only one thing," came the reply,
with compressed lips; "we must leave here,
and go further west. I know father is thinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
seriously about it. The last time that jolly
trapper, Pat O'Mara, was here, father questioned
him often about the stories he had heard
Colonel Boone tell of that wonderful country
beyond the mountains, and the beautiful Ohio
River."</p>

<p>"I think I should like that," observed the
impetuous Sandy, always eager to see new
sights, and filled with the enthusiasm of a
light-hearted boy. "If half they say about
that country be true, it must be glorious. And
the hunting and trapping we could do, Bob!
Yes, I hope father decides to join fortunes
with the first company of people passing
through here."</p>

<p>Bob said no more. He knew that the little
mother would be sorry to break many ties;
but also that she would utter no word to dissuade
her husband, when the time came. And
perhaps the more thoughtful Bob could also
foresee better than Sandy what new perils
might await the daring pilgrims who ventured
into the hunting-grounds of the warlike Shawanee
Indians.</p>

<p>Presently he made Sandy lie down to snatch
an hour's sleep, when he promised to awaken
him so that he in turn might watch. This rule<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
was carried out, and each of them had managed
to secure quite a little sleep by the time
the night was two-thirds passed.</p>

<p>It was Sandy's turn on guard. The fire was
burning briskly, the storm seemed to be slackening
up somewhat, and everything looked so
promising that the boy grew a trifle careless.
He allowed himself to doze beside the fire, his
musket between his knees. This was, after all,
hardly to be wondered at, as any one knows
who, being desperately in need of sleep, tries
to withstand the soothing heat of a warm blaze.</p>

<p>Perhaps Sandy may have been dreaming of
boyish troubles with some of the young fellows
of the town, once their warm friends, but just
now commencing to ape their parents in turning
the cold shoulder toward the Armstrong
family.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, Sandy awoke with a start.
He found the fire had gone down so that only
now and then a tongue of flame shot upward
from the log that had been burning so fiercely
the last thing he remembered.</p>

<p>And, as some grinding sound caught his ear,
he glanced up and discovered a half circle of
gleaming yellow eyes watching him from over
the top of the barricade!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>THE WOLF PACK</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Bob</span>! Wake up! The wolves!"</p>

<p>The shout rang out above the noise of the
still whining wind. Aroused from a sound
sleep by the startling cry, Bob struggled to a
sitting position. Fortunately, he was a boy not
easily rattled. The sight of those gleaming
eyes told him what had happened, and it was
perhaps more through instinct than anything
else that he immediately pushed his musket
forward and let fly at the nearest pair.</p>

<p>Sandy was not far behind, and the double
report made a crash that seemed to produce
a temporary panic among the gaunt callers.
They hastily withdrew, though with many
snarls and long-drawn howls.</p>

<p>Both boys were now on their feet, ready to
swing their guns by the barrels if necessary,
and use them as a further means of defence.
Seeing that their enemies had beaten a temporary
retreat, Bob sprang to the fire, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
kicking the partly burned log with his foot,
stirred the flame into new life.</p>

<p>"Throw on some small wood, Sandy!" he
called, as he bent over the barricade to ascertain
whether their lead had been wasted, or
found its mark.</p>

<p>"Did we get anything?" demanded the
younger boy, understanding the object of Robert's
survey, and being possessed of the frontier
hunter's instinct, which looked upon the
loss of a charge of powder and shot as next
door to a sin.</p>

<p>"One is lying here, and from the snarling
over yonder I take it they are tearing the
wounded fellow to pieces," replied the older
boy, as he proceeded to reload his musket.</p>

<p>"Well, I want that skin the worst way,"
ventured Sandy; "and if we leave the beggar
outside the fort they will spoil it. So keep a
watch while I climb over and drag the wolf
inside."</p>

<p>"Be careful," warned Bob, who knew his
brother's rash inclinations only too well. He
stood ready, with both guns within reach, so
that, if at any time Sandy seemed to be in
peril, he could pour in a hot fire that must
frighten the four-footed enemy away again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>But Sandy, himself, knew better than to take
too much risk. No sooner had he seized hold
of the dead animal than he started to move
backward toward the logs that had been piled
up to form a rampart.</p>

<p>"Hurry!" cried the voice of the one on
guard. "They are coming with a rush, and
from three quarters! Leave the hide to them,
and save yourself, brother!"</p>

<p>But Sandy was an obstinate lad. He had
made up his mind to possess the skin of the
dead wolf, and did not want to relinquish it
to the tender mercies of the pack.</p>

<p>Having dragged it close to the logs, he exerted
himself to the utmost to give the weighty
animal a toss that would accomplish his purpose.
Nevertheless, but for the prompt assistance
of Bob, who clutched the beast and
dragged it over, Sandy must have failed in
his endeavor.</p>

<p>"Quick! Climb up! They are here!" he
heard shrilled in his ear.</p>

<p>In his hurry his foot slipped and he fell backward
to the ground. Just above him there
burst out a flash, and a heavy report instantly
followed. Sandy knew what it meant, and
that his faithful brother was firing at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
advancing pack in order to stop their
rush.</p>

<p>He struggled to his feet, and commenced
once more to clamber up the rude fortification,
at the same time shouting at the top of his
voice. This was done with a purpose, for he
understood full well that, like most cowardly
animals, wolves greatly fear the voice of man.</p>

<p>Bob, too, was exerting himself to the utmost.
Again came that tremendous crash, as the second
musket was discharged close to Sandy's ear.</p>

<p>Then an eager hand laid hold of him, and
he felt himself dragged over the topmost log!</p>

<p>Both boys were panting for breath, but,
thrusting one gun into Sandy's hands, Bob
started to hastily reload the other. They could
hear their enemies not ten feet away, snarling
and snapping terribly. It needed no explanation
to tell Sandy what was going on out there
in the snow; for he knew that wolves are cannibals
if pressed with hunger.</p>

<p>"It was a pretty close shave, Bob!" he
exclaimed, after he had rammed a bullet home
in his gun, and fixed the priming in the pan.</p>

<p>"And a foolhardy act," returned the other,
gravely. "If you had missed your footing a
second time you would have been pulled down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
in spite of all I could do, and that would have
been the end of us."</p>

<p>Sandy felt abashed. He knew perfectly well
that he had been guilty of a reckless feat that
might have cost both of them their lives; for
without doubt Bob would have leaped over the
barrier to his assistance, and shared his sad
fate.</p>

<p>Perhaps thoughts of the dear ones at home,
who would have mourned them so grievously,
may have caused the boy to resolve upon a
wiser course the next time he found himself
tempted to take hazardous chances.</p>

<p>They stood on guard, and waited to see what
their enemies would do when they had finished
their meal.</p>

<p>"I hope they will go away, and leave us
alone," said Sandy, uneasily.</p>

<p>"That would be almost too good to be true,"
remarked Bob, who knew more about the habits
of animals than his brother. "Instead, I
fear that the taste of food they have had will
only make them more savage."</p>

<p>"Look! they are beginning to creep closer
again!" exclaimed Sandy, a minute later, with
a feeling of renewed uneasiness.</p>

<p>"Then we had better begin to shoot again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
and make every bullet count. Let me start the
ball rolling, boy," said Bob, as he picked out
a dark form advancing slowly over the white
snow.</p>

<p>Resting his musket across the upper log, he
took a careful aim and fired. With the report
a series of howls burst forth, and many forms
were seen dashing this way and that. Some
fled, only to come back again when they scented
a new feast, and in another minute the wolf
that had fallen before the gun of the young
pioneer was affording his mates an additional
scrap of dinner.</p>

<p>"Now, wait until I have reloaded, and then
you do as well," remarked the calm Bob, who
had learned many valuable lessons from older
hunters; and he knew how dangerous it would
be for them to be caught with empty guns,
should their foes attempt to rush the shelter
in a body.</p>

<p>Sandy, nothing loth, picked out his victim,
and when his brother gave the word he pressed
the trigger with more or less delight.</p>

<p>"That is one the less, I reckon," he remarked,
as he quickly dropped the butt of the
musket on the frozen ground, and commenced
to handle his powder horn, to measure out sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
of the precious black grains for another
charge.</p>

<p>"But I fear that for every beast we drop
two new ones come out of the woods," said
Bob, believing that they should understand the
worst, and not deceive themselves with false
hopes.</p>

<p>Sandy was for keeping up the fusillade, but
his wiser brother had already recognized the
folly of wasting their scanty ammunition so
hastily.</p>

<p>"How many more bullets have you in your
pouch?" he asked, quietly.</p>

<p>"Just three," replied the other, his enthusiasm
checked.</p>

<p>"And I have only four," Bob went on; "so
you see at the most we can only account for
seven of the beasts. After that it would be
hand to hand. We must hold off as long as we
can, reserving our ammunition for a desperate
extremity."</p>

<p>"How long will it be before dawn comes?"
asked Sandy, anxiously.</p>

<p>Of watches or clocks the pioneers had none;
but most boys knew how to tell time from the
stars, or from mere instinct; just as one accustomed
to arousing at a certain hour realizes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
that the time has come, although all may be
darkness about him.</p>

<p>Bob scanned the dull heavens through the
branches of the trees. And as it happened
there came a little break in the clouds just
then, through which he caught a glimpse of the
moon.</p>

<p>"I think that it will only be an hour now
before daylight comes," he said with a sense
of satisfaction in his voice; "and, besides, the
storm is at an end, for there the moon shows
through the clouds."</p>

<p>"But the wolves are creeping closer all the
time," declared Sandy, as he looked over the
barrier. "Just see, there must be an awful
heap of the critters, Bob. Do you think they
will try to climb over here?"</p>

<p>"It may be," replied the other, "but so
long as we can wield our guns they shall not
get a footing inside our fort. Shoot only as
a last resort. And if the very worst comes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, what then, Bob?"</p>

<p>"Try to climb up to the topmost root above.
Perhaps we might manage to hold out until
daylight frightens them away. But here they
come, Sandy!"</p>

<p>In another minute the two boys were striking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
at the heads of such daring animals as ventured
to show above the top of the low rampart.
The heavy muskets were fair weapons of offence
for such work; though more than once
Bob warned his impulsive brother to be careful,
lest he strike a log and break his gun, which
would be a serious catastrophe, indeed.</p>

<p>Their quarters were so confined that it was
only with considerable difficulty they managed
to strike fairly. But many a venturesome wolf
was knocked back when those rising and falling
muskets came in contact with his hairy head,
and, amidst the savage howls that arose without
the barricade, snarls of pain might have
been distinguished.</p>

<p>At times the work slackened somewhat, allowing
the panting boys a chance to catch their
breath, but only to go at it again with renewed
energy.</p>

<p>How the long minutes dragged by, with all
this tremendous excitement stirring their blood
to fever heat! Sandy cast many a despairing
look up at the moon, now plainly seen in the
clearing heavens, as though he fancied that it
must be remaining stationary, and the night
becoming interminable.</p>

<p>Would morning never come? Must they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
carry on this bitter struggle only to be overwhelmed
by superior numbers in the end?</p>

<p>Three times now one of them had found it
necessary to fire, when things seemed to have
reached a state approaching desperation.</p>

<p>"Courage!" shouted Bob, as he brought his
gunstock down on the head of a hungry wolf.
"Look to the east, boy! The dawn has come
at last!"</p>

<p>It was even so, and, thrilled with renewed
hope, Sandy was enabled to keep up the good
fight until by degrees the wolves began to sneak
away, until finally the last of the savage horde
had gone.</p>

<p>Would they ever forget that stirring night?
Sandy believed nothing could exceed the excitement
through which they had just passed;
but, perhaps, if they migrated to that mysterious
country beyond the great chain of mountains,
there amid new scenes he might find an
opportunity to change his mind.</p>

<p>Over the fire they cooked another meal of
the fine venison which they had saved from the
half-starved wolves.</p>

<p>"And now to head for home!" cried Sandy,
as he took up the pack to show that he wished
to do his share of the burden-carrying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>Forgotten were the aches of the night in the
thought of once more rejoining those so dear
to them about the family hearth, where the fire
blazed in the wide-throated chimney, and the
brass kettle bubbled on the hob.</p>

<p>They had been tramping for half an hour,
steadily onward, when Bob called a halt, declaring
that it was high time Sandy turned the
bundle of meat over to him.</p>

<p>This the other was really not at all loth to
do, for he had been staggering of late through
the deep snow, as his burden began to tell on
him. Still, not for worlds would the proud boy
have confessed that he was actually tired.</p>

<p>Bob fashioned the hitch a little better, so
that it would rest easier across his shoulder.
He had just leaned forward, intending to give
the bundle a sudden hoist, when he stopped in
the act.</p>

<p>From some point not a great way off there
came the sudden report of, not a musket with
its heavy boom, but a hunter's clear-toned rifle.</p>

<p>And accompanying the sound they caught a
loud voice raised in an excited shout, as though
some one was striving against difficulties that
threatened to overcome him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

<small>WHEN KATE CAME HOME</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Some</span> one is in trouble, Bob!" cried the
younger Armstrong boy, as these sounds came
floating to their ears.</p>

<p>"Yes, and a white man, too," said Bob, as
he tossed the bundle of venison up into the
crotch of a big oak tree close at hand. "We
must see if we can help him."</p>

<p>Sandy was nothing loth. He knew full well
that the unwritten law of the woods compelled
every man to extend assistance when he met
with one in need, and from the nature of the
racket they could imagine that something quite
out of the ordinary must be taking place.</p>

<p>The two lads set off on a run, eager to reach
the spot as quickly as possible. True, they
were rather short of ammunition just then, but
so long as a single load remained to their guns
they were ready to use it in behalf of any one
in distress.</p>

<p>"Listen, brother," said Sandy, when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
had covered some little distance; "surely we
have heard that voice before."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 351px;">
<img src="images/i063.jpg" width="351" height="500" alt="man scrambling up tree with bear wanting to join him" />
<div class="caption">"KICKING FURIOUSLY AT A LEAN BLACK BEAR, JUST BELOW HIM."</div>
</div>

<p>"Yes," returned Bob, with a little laugh,
"it is our old friend, Pat O'Mara, without a
doubt; but what can he have stumbled into
now? Pat is always looking for a 'ruction,'
as he calls it, and generally finding what he
wants."</p>

<p>"Perhaps the wolves, after leaving us, may
have treed him," suggested Sandy, with something
like a broad grin appearing on his freckled
face.</p>

<p>But the other shook his head in the negative.
He seldom jumped at conclusions as did Sandy,
and usually weighed his words before speaking.</p>

<p>"Hardly that, boy," he observed; "we
would have heard their howls before this. And
besides, we have good reason to know that
wolves are arrant cowards in the daytime."</p>

<p>"Well, let us run on again, for evidently
Pat is in need of help. This may pay him back
for dragging me out of that quicksand last
summer, when I thought my last hour had arrived,"
and Sandy once more started on a trot
in the direction of the spot whence the shouts
arose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon another sound mingled with the cries
of the Irish trapper.</p>

<p>"It must be a bear!" said Sandy over his
shoulder, as he ran.</p>

<p>Bob was of the same opinion, for the ferocious
growls that came down the breeze could
surely have been produced by no other among
the woods creatures.</p>

<p>Then they burst through a thicket, and suddenly
came in sight of a spectacle so remarkable
that both boys stood still to gape and
grin.</p>

<p>A rather stout man was sitting up in the
wreck of an old tree, kicking furiously at a lean
black bear, just below him, that was striking
with his claws in the endeavor to fasten upon
the legging of the other's foot.</p>

<p>While he thus kicked, the man in fringed
buckskin was constantly talking, often giving
vent to a shout of joy when his foot chanced
to land against the head of his hairy enemy.</p>

<p>On the ground lay a rifle; but the bear did
not seem to be seriously wounded in any way,
which fact puzzled the boys not a little, because
Pat O'Mara had the reputation of being a marvellous
shot, and they remembered having
heard the report of the gun a short time back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>When he saw the new arrivals, the trapper
let out a cheer that told of solid satisfaction.
And indeed, to tell the truth, his situation was
anything but pleasant, and the end uncertain,
with that wicked old bear determined to get
him by fair means or foul.</p>

<p>"Haroo!" shouted the trapper, waving his
coonskin cap vigorously above his red head;
"sure yees are the byes to hilp me out av
throuble, so ye be! Alriddy he scents me
frinds, and is backin' down out av the three.
Just take up alongside the fut av the same,
and put a flea in his ear before he can turn to
do yees any harrm. Haroo! Make a clane job
av the same, remimber. An' wan at a time,
av ye plaze!"</p>

<p>"You take him first, Sandy," said Bob, with
his usual thoughtfulness, always willing that
his brother should carry off the honors when
there was a choice.</p>

<p>He stood alongside, and held his musket in
readiness, so that in case the first leaden missile
failed to finish old Bruin he might join in
the affair.</p>

<p>The bear, while still angry, was evidently
considerably concerned over the coming of reinforcements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>Sandy knew how to do the part of the business
that had been entrusted to him.</p>

<p>"Stiddy, lad, stiddy!" warned the trapper,
already following the bear down the tree.
"Make a sure job av it now; and don't spile
the pelt!"</p>

<p>Bang! went the heavy charge which was in
Sandy's flint-lock musket. The bear immediately
fell in a heap on the ground. Bob stood
there, ready to add the finishing touch if absolutely
necessary; but among hunters it is always
understood that there shall be no interference
at such times unless positively needed;
and the game had been placed in Sandy's
hands.</p>

<p>And in this case there was no need, for the
bear, after making a desperate attempt to
struggle to his feet, dropped, and lay still;
whereupon Sandy and the good-natured Irish
trapper united in a cheer that made the woods
ring again and again.</p>

<p>"Afther all, it is Sandy's pelt, and it's glad
I am he had the good sinse to sind his bullet
back av the forelig instid av liftin' the baste's
hid," declared the man who had been rescued
from the tree.</p>

<p>"But how comes it that we found you in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
such a queer scrape, Pat?" asked Bob, with
a twinkle in his eye; for he knew very well
something must have gone amiss, or the usually
clever woodsman would not have found
himself in so sore a strait.</p>

<p>"Arrah! it's ashamed I am to till yees, me
byes; but sure thot was a time Patsy found
himself up the wrong tree," admitted the other,
who was so good-natured that he could even
laugh at a joke on himself.</p>

<p>"And not much of a tree at that, I should
say," remarked Sandy dryly, as he surveyed
the stump which had been the scene of the trapper's
adventure. "Seems to me, Pat, that if
I wanted to climb a tree, and fight it out with
a bear, I would pick a bigger one than this
rotten old thing."</p>

<p>"Oh! ye wud, eh? Phat if the bear was so
clost till yer heels that ye had to shin up anything
at all?" objected Pat, with a comical
grin.</p>

<p>"Well, in that case no one could blame
you," returned Bob. "Tell us how it came
you failed to kill the beast when you fired."</p>

<p>"Sure, and ye are mistaken, Bob; niver a
shot did I take at the ould beggar," said the
other, positively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys looked at each other.</p>

<p>"But surely we heard a shot," observed
Sandy.</p>

<p>"Yis, but thot was the bear shootin', I give
ye my word," the man in buckskin avowed.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell us that the bear fired
your gun at you?" questioned Sandy, who
knew the joking propensity of the jolly Irish
trapper.</p>

<p>"Whirra! now, who said he fired <i>at</i> me?
Afther chasing me up here the ugly ould baste
took a notion to scratch at me gun down on the
ground; and as by bad luck the hammer was
back, bedad if he didn't manage somehow to
pull the trigger. Sure, if ye look here, yees
can see the hole the bullet made in the butt av
the tree!"</p>

<p>At this frank declaration on the part of the
trapper Sandy was unable to keep a straight
face any longer, but broke out into a roar.
Nor was Pat long in joining him, seeming to
think it a fine joke.</p>

<p>"But afther all it was the bear that hild the
small ind av the sthick," the hero of the adventure
remarked as, with knife in hand, he
started to remove the heavy skin of the victim.
Sandy tramped back to secure the venison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
from the crotch in the oak, while Bob aided the
trapper.</p>

<p>Pat was a roving blade. He loved the wide
expanse of wilderness, and had made several
long trips into the west, though as yet never
as far as Colonel Boone and his party had
gone. He had always been a good friend of
the Armstrongs, and was particularly fond of
the two brothers.</p>

<p>After about an hour's delay the boys, accompanied
by O'Mara, made a start for the cabin
in the clearing, each one well loaded with packages
of meat. The bear had not been in very
good condition, having hibernated all winter,
and lived upon his fat; but still the experienced
trapper knew just what portions to carry
along, such as would afford good stews to the
hungry Armstrongs.</p>

<p>It was just noon when they came in sight of
the cabin. Of course it was the anxious mother
who sighted the boys first, as she stood within
the open doorway, shading her eyes with her
hand so as to shut out the glare of the sun on
the snow.</p>

<p>Soon the newcomers were sitting in front of
the big blaze in the yawning fireplace, where
a pot bubbled and gave out appetizing odors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
telling the story of their adventures; while
David, the look of concern gone for the time
being from his face, undid the packages of supplies
that had been secured.</p>

<p>Indeed it was a happy little party that sat
around the plain deal table. What mattered
it that the chairs were home-made, that Sandy
even had to utilize a three-legged stool; that
instead of boards the cabin had only a hard
earthen floor; while there was an utter absence
of anything beyond the absolute necessities
of existence, as lived in those primitive
times? (<a href="#Note_4">Note 4.</a>)</p>

<p>Love dwelt there, and smoothed all the rough
edges. Looking into the proud and apparently
happy face of the little mother the two boys
were pleased to think fortune had been so very
kind, and allowed them to bring home such a
goodly supply of meat; for the larder was
almost bare.</p>

<p>Pat was always the life of any party. When
he chose to exert himself things went on with
a whirl, and there was much merriment. If
Mr. Armstrong meant to ask his advice about
the plans he was forming connected with their
emigration to the new country beyond the horizon
in the west, he held his peace just then, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
wishing to arouse the boys as yet; for he knew
Sandy's impetuous ways, and how the facts
must soon become public property once he
learned them.</p>

<p>The thing that worried David Armstrong
most was his uncertainty as to where he could
secure money enough to fit out for the long
journey. They really needed at least two
horses, upon which the bedding and extra
clothing, as well as cooking utensils, could be
loaded; for no one would think of carrying anything
else over such an unknown road, hundreds
of miles into the untrodden wilderness,
where most of the travelling must be done over
the winding buffalo trails.</p>

<p>However, he had a plan, thanks to a suggestion
on the part of his thoughtful wife, and
with the assistance of Pat O'Mara he fancied
he could secure what he wished so earnestly,
a loan from a man he had once befriended,
and who was now well-to-do.</p>

<p>They had just finished their meal when
Sandy discovered something through the little
window near which he happened to be sitting.</p>

<p>"Why, would you believe it, mother, here
comes sister Kate!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>All of them made a start to leave the table;
and then, influenced perhaps by some hidden
fear, they turned to exchange glances. Could
anything have happened that the girl was coming
home at this unusual hour; for the cabin
where she had been employed was half a mile
away?</p>

<p>The door opened to admit a pretty little girl
with flaxen curls, just now sadly awry; and the
eye of Mrs. Armstrong saw instantly that Kate
had certainly been indulging in a good cry,
something she was seldom guilty of doing, being
possessed of a sunny disposition very like
her mother's, though perhaps she had also a
dash of her father's peppery nature.</p>

<p>At sight of the family Kate was unable to
restrain her feelings any longer, for again the
tears began to flow down her rosy cheeks.</p>

<p>"Why, Kate, my child, what has happened?
Why are you here, when your duty is at the
Hodgkins?" asked Mrs. Armstrong, hastening
to throw a reassuring arm around the
shoulders of the slight figure that was shaking
with emotion.</p>

<p>The girl looked up, the tears shining in her
blue eyes. There was also a flash of temper
to be seen there, and evidently Kate had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
recently aroused to a point where she could
stand things no longer.</p>

<p>"I am done with the Hodgkins," she cried,
stamping her little foot on the clay floor; "I
will never go back there again! I hate them,
every one! Oh! it was so mean, so cowardly
to say that!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Armstrong turned pale, and her husband
said something under his breath, as they
exchanged uneasy glances.</p>

<p>"Tell us, what did they dare say to you?"
demanded Sandy, gritting his teeth.</p>

<p>"They mocked me, and said my father was
a barn-burner!" sobbed the girl, bitterly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>THE DIE IS CAST</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Say</span> it again, child!" roared the head of
the little family, as he jumped to his feet, his
strong features working.</p>

<p>"David, be careful; let me mother the girl
a bit, until she gets over her cry!" said Mrs.
Armstrong; and as usual her soothing voice
gained the mastery over the temper of the
impulsive man.</p>

<p>Bob and Sandy exchanged looks. Already
smarting under the injustice of many who had
called themselves friends in times past, this
new indignity aroused all the Scotch combativeness
in their natures.</p>

<p>Instinctively they clenched their fists, and
drew together, as though by mutual sympathy.
The same thought had flashed into each mind&mdash;that
<i>something</i> must be done to check this
rising tide before it utterly overwhelmed the
Armstrong family.</p>

<p>The mother saw that look, and in her heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
understood. Proud she might be of the love
that influenced her boys; still there was something
higher than loyalty by which she must
be governed, and this was duty.</p>

<p>She managed to draw the whole sad story
from the girl, amid several little tear-storms.
Then she soothed and quieted Kate, who in
the shelter of that motherly breast found comfort
and presently dried her tears.</p>

<p>The Irish trapper was a witness of this little
excitement. He frowned, too, for his nature
was impulsive, and he keenly sympathized with
his friends. But at the same time more than
once a ghost of a smile would chase across his
jovial face. Evidently Pat O'Mara was thinking
of the plans which he had been forming,
and by means of which he hoped to influence
the Armstrongs to leave this hateful community,
where their worth was not appreciated.</p>

<p>A short time later Bob gave Sandy a sly dig
in the ribs, and made a quick motion with his
head. Apparently the younger brother understood
what was meant, for soon afterwards,
when he thought he was unobserved, he slipped
out of the cabin.</p>

<p>Just as he expected, he found Bob awaiting
him under the trees where bubbled up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
spring which, winter and summer, supplied
them with the clearest of water.</p>

<p>And Bob was evidently in a mighty serious
frame of mind, even for him. His face looked
gloomy and forbidding, while he continually
gnawed his upper lip, after a fashion he had
when deeply aroused.</p>

<p>Sandy recognized the signs. He had seen
them on several occasions before. Once a settlement
bully&mdash;for they had them in those
early days just the same as now&mdash;was engaged
in the, to him, delightful task of abusing
a lad much smaller than himself, when the
Armstrongs came upon the scene. The bully
had a crony at hand, just as big as himself,
and snapped his fingers at Bob when the other
asked him to desist. Then it was that Sandy
had seen his brother's face assume the same
expression that it carried now.</p>

<p>Unable to stand the sight of such cowardly
practices, Bob had attacked the fellow, and,
spurred on by the righteousness of his cause,
succeeded in giving him the beating he so
richly deserved, while Sandy and the abused
boy took care of the bully's friend.</p>

<p>There were other cases of a similar character,
too, and Sandy would never forget a single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
one of them. To him his brother Bob was the
embodiment of all that was noble in a boy.</p>

<p>"There is no other way, Sandy," said the
older one, shaking his head, as though he had
a disagreeable duty to perform, which could
not be evaded.</p>

<p>"You are right," declared Sandy, hotly.
"I know, and you know, who is to blame for
those children saying such things. Did not we
hear their father, Abner Hodgkins, say almost
the same thing just three days ago, when we
passed him at the door of the alehouse?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bob, between his teeth, "and
how red he turned when he knew that we must
have heard him. And he is the man our father
once helped when he was sorely distressed!
This insult can only be wiped out in one way."</p>

<p>"In only one way, brother," breathed
Sandy.</p>

<p>"And since mother has brought father to
her way of thinking, it falls on us to give Abner
Hodgkins his lesson," went on Bob, his eyes
taking on a steely glitter at thought of the
many ill turns that had of late been showered
on their heads.</p>

<p>"But we must not let mother know," ventured
the younger brother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>"Surely not. Mother would never consent.
In her eyes only the last necessity excuses
fighting. After it is all over she will forgive
us," said Bob, his voice unconsciously becoming
very tender.</p>

<p>"Perhaps they will have some care how
they let their wicked tongues wag after they
hear what has happened to one tattler," went
on Sandy.</p>

<p>"Then you are with me?" asked the elder
brother, eagerly.</p>

<p>"The sooner the better!" cried Sandy, impulsive
as usual; "let us go now, and strike
while the iron is hot!"</p>

<p>"Agreed. For Kate said he had arrived
home just as she left, for he called out after
her to know where she was going. I am ready,
Sandy!"</p>

<p>The fact that the man under discussion was
one of the most muscular in all that border
community did not seem to worry the two boys
at all, for they were fairly burning with a desire
to avenge the constant insults cast upon
their loved ones.</p>

<p>Grasping the arm of Sandy, Bob turned
around to hurry away ere any one could see
them, and, guessing their mission, bring it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
a halt. Then he caught his breath, and his pale
face took on the color of confusion. For he
found himself confronted by his mother, the
very last person in all the world whom he
would have wished to see under such conditions.</p>

<p>While listening to Kate's pitiful story she
had observed the signal that passed between
them. Understanding her boys, she knew what
thoughts must be passing through their heated
brains. And when they slipped away, unobserved
as they believed, that fond heart had
lost no time in following.</p>

<p>"I hope, my sons," she said sweetly, as she
placed a hand on an arm of each, "that you
are not thinking of doing aught that would only
add to our troubles. Heaven knows that we
have enough to bear now. Two wrongs, you
know, never yet made a right. We must bear
our cross, knowing that in good season this
bitter cloud will pass away. Promise me that
you will neither of you seek Abner Hodgkins,
nor have one word to say to him should you
meet!"</p>

<p>The two confused boys looked at each other
rather whimsically. They knew they could refuse
their mother nothing. And perhaps, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
at that moment they realized the utter folly
of the course they had mapped out.</p>

<p>So they promised, and, with an arm about
the waist of each, she accompanied them back
to the cabin.</p>

<p>The balance of that day passed slowly.
Every one was uneasy save possibly Pat
O'Mara, whose jolly disposition could never be
cast down. And that evening, after supper, as
they gathered around the blazing fire, he exerted
himself as never before to sway the
minds of these good friends.</p>

<p>The boys sat there on the bench that stood
against the wall, and listened with wide-open
ears when by degrees the trapper came around
to the entrancing subject of that magical country
whose beauties he seemed never to tire of
telling. David Armstrong and his wife harkened
also, but said little, leaving it to Bob and
his brother to ask questions.</p>

<p>It was a cozy picture. The flames darted up
the wide-throated chimney and took the place
of the customary candle in lighting the room,
glancing from the walls, where the chinks between
the roughly hewn logs had been filled
with hardened clay, and then whitewashed.</p>

<p>Herbs hung from the rafters overhead. High<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
up alongside the chimney several packages of
the dried venison Sandy disliked so much had
their places. The shiny brass kettle, an heirloom
in the family, stood upon the hob near
the flames, and occasionally sang a low
accompaniment to the trapper's enticing
tales.</p>

<p>Would the new country offer them as comfortable
a home as this? After all, so long
as the mother were spared, it must ever be her
deft hand that made home what it was; and
no matter whether here in Virginia, or far off
on the banks of the storied Ohio, it would be
the same.</p>

<p>"But how about the Indians, Pat?" asked
Sandy finally. "You have told us little of the
red men. Are they disposed to be friendly;
or would we have to fight whenever we ran
across them?"</p>

<p>"That is the only darrk spot to the picture,
me byes," returned the trapper, with a sigh.
"Sorry am I to say the same, but the rid
divels are all for makin' throuble. But 'tis
numbers that may hould thim in check. Troth,
if enough whites iver r'ach the shore of that
enchantin' river, they kin bid the Injuns defiance.
In union there is strength, ye know,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Sandy, bye. 'Tis thim same rid divils that
gives me pain in me hearrt."</p>

<p>To the boys, however, this was not so serious
a drawback. In common with most young fellows
of the day they had a contempt for the
valor of the native sons of the forest. It was
not so with the gentle mother; and her eyes
involuntarily sought those of her husband,
while she shivered at the thought of the loneliness
that must encompass pilgrims who emigrated
beyond the mountain chain, losing themselves
in the untracked wilderness.</p>

<p>But David was himself rapidly coming
around. It is human nature not to compare
the ills we know not of with those visible ones
by which we find ourselves confronted on every
hand.</p>

<p>And when Mary saw the way in which his
face was set, she knew, just as well as if he
had spoken, that the die was cast. They would
go into the wilderness, and hew out a new home
<i>somewhere</i>. The sturdy spirit of the early pioneers
had been fully awakened, and the call of
the west could no longer be ignored. Destiny
was pushing them on.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>INTO THE UNKNOWN LAND</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the following two days peace reigned
around the humble home of the Armstrongs;
but this was partly because no one went into
the town again save the father, who came home
on the second afternoon leading two horses, at
sight of which the boys could hardly repress
their shouts of satisfaction.</p>

<p>This told them that the die was indeed cast,
for little need they would have of horses, save
as beasts of burden in case of migration.
Wagons could not be used, so O'Mara had
declared, because much of the long journey
must be accomplished along those winding buffalo
trails that traversed the forest, for of
roads there were absolutely none.</p>

<p>It was at this time there arose a necessity
for some supplies, and the brothers were told
to go into town to obtain the same. Apparently
David had succeeded in securing the
funds he so badly needed, showing that one
staunch friend must have stood by him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>The mother looked wistfully after her boys
when they hurried away, filled with new enthusiasm
because of the nearness of the time
when they would depart from the scene of all
their woes.</p>

<p>"I do hope they will restrain themselves,
and not get into any trouble," she said to her
husband, who was busily engaged with the
horses, a new feature in their experience, and
one that gave them much concern.</p>

<p>David smiled back, for it seemed to be his
turn to comfort.</p>

<p>"Have no fear of the lads, wife," he said
heartily. "They are good boys, and true, of
whom we can well be proud. Sandy is o'er
impulsive, it is true; but Robert possesses the
balance. We have need to be thankful to Providence
that we possess two such sons when
about to start upon such a hazardous journey
as this."</p>

<p>An hour or so later Pat O'Mara saw the
brothers returning. They carried several
packages, which constituted their purchases
of necessities, simple though these were. But
the sharp eyes of the trapper saw something
more which they were carrying. Several
scratches marked their faces, and Sandy's left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
optic seemed to be in a degree of mourning,
all of which told the astute Irish trapper that
there must have been a fracas of some sort.
He knew well those signs; and it was with
difficulty he managed to conceal the grin that
forced itself upon his genial face.</p>

<p>Of course there could be no concealing these
evident marks of battle. Nor did the boys attempt
to do so.</p>

<p>"You have been in trouble, son," said the
mother, as she took the package from Sandy,
and looked upon the cuts and scratches on his
cheek.</p>

<p>It was Bob of course who showed signs of
contrition; Sandy, on the other hand, threw
his head back, as though proud of his scars.
To him every one stood for an honor mark.</p>

<p>"I could not help it, mother dear," he said.
"They taunted me, three of them, and began
to strike me. Then Bob came, and it was better,
though still uneven. But we were furious,
and would not give in; would we, Bob?"</p>

<p>"Who could have been so cowardly and
cruel?" asked Mary, as she hurried to get
warm water in a basin, so that the wounds
might be properly bathed, and some homemade
liniment put upon them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who but that same bully, Armand Whalen,"
Sandy went on, eagerly. "Once before,
Bob whipped him until he cried for mercy, and
he has never forgiven us. But never mind,
mother; we gave the cowards all they deserved.
They look much worse than we do; and besides,
they ran away in the end. These little
cuts are nothing to us. Surely we have had
others many times worse."</p>

<p>"Indeed, I am sorry to have displeased you,
mother," said Bob; "but they were all picking
on Sandy, and my blood fairly boiled. Had
there been twice as many it could have made
no difference. At any rate, they will often
think of us when we are gone, which is a satisfaction."</p>

<p>At which naive remark the mother found
herself compelled to smile. She could not be
provoked with the boys. And besides, she
knew very well what affronts they had continually
suffered.</p>

<p>Again she found her eyes drawn irresistibly
toward those of her husband. Upon his face
was a set look, as though his mind had been
made up now beyond recall.</p>

<p>"It is the last straw," he said, bitterly;
"and the end cannot come any too soon now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
to please me. I shall be glad when we have
wiped the dirt of this place from our shoes.
Boys, you did what any manly lad would find
himself compelled to do. I am not blaming
you one bit. But after this you must remain
at home."</p>

<p>"But father, there is news," said Bob, as
he suddenly remembered.</p>

<p>"They are coming here then, those brave
souls from Carolina, who head toward the setting
sun?" asked David, showing the eagerness
that possessed his soul.</p>

<p>"Yes," returned the boy; "a messenger
has arrived in town from the head man in
charge of the expedition, warning all who mean
to accompany them that they will arrive in
three days, and only stop twenty-four hours.
This is the last settlement. When they leave
here, it will be to enter the wilderness."</p>

<p>"Glory be!" exclaimed the trapper, upon
hearing this. "Then we will soon be on our
way, with all our troubles behind."</p>

<p>The good wife sighed. She did not anticipate
such glorious things as beckoned the others
on. Perhaps she had forebodings in her
gentle heart that the new perils all pioneers
must face might prove even more formidable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
than those they were leaving behind; and that
perchance one of her loved ones might find an
early grave in that new land, a victim to the
treachery of the red men.</p>

<p>But not for worlds would she utter one discouraging
word. There seemed no other
course open to them; and the women of that
day were every one of them heroines, capable
of enduring untold suffering in the search of a
place they could call home.</p>

<p>Two days afterwards, as promised, the emigrants
made their appearance. David had
gone out to meet them on one of the horses.</p>

<p>"Fetch them here to camp beside our
spring," his wife had told him; "for we may
be the only family meaning to join our fortunes
with theirs."</p>

<p>And sure enough, they camped near the
cabin in the clearing, a round three dozen in
all, including some five more or less sturdy boys
with whom Bob and Sandy fraternized at once.</p>

<p>Then began a period of bustle, as the last
preparations were undertaken by the Armstrongs.
Some of their things they gave in
charge of the one faithful neighbor who had
remained true to them through good and evil
report. Perhaps at some day an opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
might arise whereby these precious, if bulky,
heirlooms in the way of furniture could be
brought out to their new home. Just now such
a thing was not to be considered for a moment.</p>

<p>And then the last morning broke.</p>

<p>The brothers were brimming over with excitement,
nor did they feel any particular pain
over quitting the place they had for so long
called home. It had ceased to have attraction
for them since this shadow had fallen; and
they believed they would be happy to leave it
forever.</p>

<p>David Armstrong, too, managed to conceal
what feeling he may have had. But with the
little mother it was different. That humble
log cabin meant much to her, for inside those
stout walls she had spent several fairly happy
years; but she put these sad thoughts away
with a resolute hand whenever David was
near. They would do to dream over when utterly
alone, perhaps in the dark watches of
the night, in a new country, and amid strangers.</p>

<p>All was bustle and confusion. A few of the
town people had come out to see the start of
the expedition, and many were the remarks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
that were made concerning the possibilities
that awaited the daring travellers.</p>

<p>In this hour of parting some of the neighbors,
possibly overcome by contrition, tried to
make amends for their recent cruel conduct,
but David ignored all signs of friendly handshakes,
and would have none of them. The
iron had eaten too deeply into his soul.</p>

<p>The pack train of horses looked quite formidable
when lined up for the start.</p>

<p>"Twelve of them in all!" Sandy sang out,
as he stood ready to urge his animal on when
the leader gave the order to start.</p>

<p>A hardy gathering of valiant souls the emigrants
looked just then. Fortune beckoned to
them, and all seemed delightful. If they could
only have looked ahead a few months, and seen
the terrible dangers that lay in wait, doubtless
many a smile would have faded from the faces
that now looked so cheerful.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" shouted the boys, when finally
the word passed along the line, and those in
the lead began to move.</p>

<p>But there were no cheers. Those grave-faced
men realized only too well that in thus
putting their fortunes to the touch, by venturing
into that unknown world of which so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
had been told, they were carrying not only
their own lives, but also those dear to them,
in the hollow of their hands.</p>

<p>The caravan moved away amid the sound of
many voices, as the boys urged their pack
steeds along. Never once did Sandy glance
back toward the home he was leaving; he
seemed given up entirely to the witchery of
the adventure.</p>

<p>But one pair of eyes turned for a last wistful
look at the familiar log cabin, with the
grand old oak hovering above its humble roof,
that had sheltered her little brood so faithfully
these years. And then a turn in the trail shut
out the view. Mary Armstrong heaved a sigh,
and then resolutely strove to think only of
what might be in store for them in the new
world to which they were journeying.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>THE PERILS OF THE WILDERNESS</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Did</span> you see that, Bob?"</p>

<p>Sandy clutched his brother by the arm as he
whispered these words, and both of them sank
back lower behind the fringe of bushes.</p>

<p>Some weeks had gone by since they had left
the old home. By slow degrees the mountains
had been surmounted, and they were now nearing
the region of the Ohio, on the banks of
which the settlers hoped to find homes.</p>

<p>There were eleven men in the party, with
seven women, and a round dozen children of
varying ages.</p>

<p>Day by day the party of settlers had plodded
onward, with their faces ever toward the west.
Often they saw the prowling panther near the
camp; and it was a common thing to have a
deer or a buffalo spring up in advance of the
caravan, to go bounding or lumbering away,
startled by this first glimpse of white men.</p>

<p>As there was no road it had been utterly
impossible to make use of such clumsy vehicles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
as the early settlers knew. Upon the backs of
the horses was piled all their possessions; and
besides, frequently the women and children had
to be added to the loads.</p>

<p>The settlers considered themselves fortunate
in having with them a man who had gone over
this trail before. Pat O'Mara kept at the head
of the column throughout each long day.</p>

<p>Many times they had to make detours in
order to overcome obstacles in the way that
could not be directly overcome. Sometimes
these took the form of deep ravines, the banks
of which were too steep to allow the horses
to obtain a foothold; then again they might be
windfalls, where the grand forest trees had
been razed, along a track half a mile broad, by
some fierce tornado.</p>

<p>When night drew near O'Mara selected some
favorable place for a camp which offered opportunities
for defence. For they never allowed
themselves to fall into a state of security
that might induce fatal carelessness.</p>

<p>Some days the settlers made fair progress
under favoring conditions; then again they
would strike a section of country where every
mile had to be won, with patient effort, foot
by foot. And they were always vigilant, believing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
in that motto of the Puritans: "Trust
in the Lord; but <i>keep your powder dry!</i>"</p>

<p>Each night, as the cheerful fires crackled,
and the women gathered around to prepare the
evening meal, the tired men would bring in
wood for use while the darkness lasted; and
then throw together some sort of defence.</p>

<p>While as yet these preparations had been
apparently needless, still the cautious O'Mara
warned them that they were now nearing the
hunting grounds of the warlike Shawanees;
and that any day some party might discover
the caravan, and carry the news of their coming
to the nearest Indian village.</p>

<p>As yet they had really seen little of the red
men. Twice hunters, who were out securing
fresh food for the party, had reported catching
glimpses of dusky figures darting in and
out among the trees; but no attack had as yet
been made upon any members of the little expedition.</p>

<p>Bob and his brother were in the habit of
going out on alternate days, and looking for
game. As this was plentiful they had little
trouble in securing a deer whenever the larder
got low.</p>

<p>One day they had tramped ahead of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
party, following the old buffalo trail which the
horses would take as they came along and which
led westward. In this way, if they secured
game, it would not be necessary to carry it far
in order to join the others.</p>

<p>As yet they had seen nothing worth shooting,
when Sandy made the remark with which this
chapter begins.</p>

<p>His brother stared in his face, and there
was a serious look in his eyes, as he made
answer.</p>

<p>"Yes, I saw it; and I'm afraid it was an
Indian, brother."</p>

<p>"With feathers in his scalp-lock, which
means war!" continued Sandy, who was always
questioning Pat O'Mara, and hence had
picked up considerable knowledge concerning
the red men and their habits.</p>

<p>Again did the two boys exchange uneasy
looks.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose he is alone?" whispered
Sandy, presently.</p>

<p>"Let us try to see. Raise your head, inch
by inch, until you can look over the tops of
these bushes; but be careful," continued the
other.</p>

<p>Back to back they started to do this, intending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
to cover the entire surrounding woods with
a close scrutiny.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was an odd twanging sound
heard. Bob knew instinctively that it was the
recoil of a bow-string, and he dragged his
brother down instantly.</p>

<p>Then came a heavy thud close by their ears.
Looking around, the brothers saw a feathered
shaft quivering, with its flint head buried in
the trunk of a tree.</p>

<p>It was the first time in all their lives that
either of them had been under fire. The mere
thought that some human being was endeavoring
to do them deadly injury caused a momentary
thrill. But, in those early days, boys
were made of sterling material; and, after
that involuntary shudder, they faced the danger
resolutely, with a spirit that would have
well become their father.</p>

<p>"We must get out of here," whispered Bob,
as he prepared to crawl along in the shelter
of the bushes.</p>

<p>"But which way?" demanded Sandy, confused;
for how were they to know just where
the unseen enemy might be hidden?</p>

<p>"That arrow came from yonder; therefore
we must turn the other way," was the convincing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
argument Bob advanced, and his brother
immediately saw the logic of it.</p>

<p>Bob led the retreat, with Sandy trailing close
at his heels. Each lad clutched his gun in a
nervous grip, and strained his ears to catch
the slightest suspicious sound near by.</p>

<p>So they crept on, for ten minutes, without
anything happening, and by degrees Sandy felt
his courage return. Perhaps, after all, there
had only been a single savage; and, again, he
may have been as frightened as they were,
making off immediately after discharging that
lone arrow!</p>

<p>Their hearts still beating faster than was
their wont, the boys came to the termination
of the line of dense bushes. If they expected
to go on from this point they must of necessity
change their tactics entirely, and expose themselves
to the gaze of any lurker.</p>

<p>"Let's run for it!" suggested Sandy, at a
loss for any other plan.</p>

<p>"No, I have another idea," returned his
resourceful brother.</p>

<p>"Then let us have it, quick, Bob!" whispered
the other, to whom inaction was always
more or less irksome.</p>

<p>"You start off as though meaning to escape,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
dodging this way and that. He will perhaps
believe that I was cut down by that hissing
arrow. Then, if he shows himself, I can get
him, perhaps," Bob ventured.</p>

<p>Sandy fell in with the idea at once, although
he realized the danger.</p>

<p>"Give the word, then, Bob, and let me go.
Anything is better than this suspense," he
said, immediately, starting to get on his feet.</p>

<p>"If you hear me shout, drop flat," the elder
brother said, impressively. "That will mean
he is trying to shoot at you. And if you hear
the report of my gun, seek shelter behind some
tree."</p>

<p>The last thing Sandy heard as he gained a
half-erect position, and started off on a lope,
was the click of Bob's gun-lock as he prepared
for business. No doubt the boy's heart was
pounding like a hammer as he thus exposed
himself to the aim of an enemy; but, nothing
daunted, he kept right on, looking to the right
and to the left as he scurried along.</p>

<p>And Bob, left behind amid the bushes, lifted
his head slowly, so that he could see all that
transpired, a grim expression on his young
face, such as the stern realities of those early
days stamped upon many a boyish countenance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>Ha! There was a movement not far away
that his keen ear caught. Not turning his head
a particle he twisted his eyes around to the left,
and immediately discovered a bent figure that
was skulking along, now dodging behind a tree,
and anon crouching flat, as Sandy threatened
to look around.</p>

<p>It was an Indian, rigged out in all the horrid
paint and feathers that marked a Shawanee
brave on the warpath. He gripped a short,
but stout, bow in his hands; and even as Bob
caught sight of him seemed to be fitting a feathered
shaft to the tense gut that served as a
cord.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly it was his intention to shoot
again, and this time, as Sandy's back would be
turned, there was a strong probability that the
arrow might find a victim.</p>

<p>Bob looked no further; his mind was made
up, and, raising his flint-lock musket to his
shoulder, he glanced hastily along the barrel.</p>

<p>The red man was in the very act of letting
fly his arrow when the bang of the heavily
charged musket awoke the echoes of the forest.
Sandy had not forgotten his part in the programme,
for no sooner did he hear that discharge
than he made a quick spring to a neighboring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
beech tree, back of which he crouched,
ready to do his part in the game.</p>

<p>The Indian fell down, but, immediately
scrambling to his feet with a whoop, ran off
like a frightened deer. He was holding his
right arm as he went, from which fact Bob
gained the opinion that his hastily sent bullet
must have struck that part of the enemy's
anatomy.</p>

<p>Then he vanished in the depths of the forest,
while Bob reloaded as fast as he could work
his hands.</p>

<p>"Are there any more of them?" called
Sandy, as he poked his gun out from behind
the beech, ready to make use of the same at
the slightest provocation.</p>

<p>"I do not think so," replied Bob, considerably
relieved at not discovering a horde of
dusky figures rushing toward them, as he had
feared would be the case.</p>

<p>Nor did they notice any signs of enemies
around them. Sandy insisted upon going over
to the spot where the Indian had dropped his
bow and arrow, at the time he received Bob's
bullet in his arm.</p>

<p>"Some of them might refuse to believe that
we had met a real Indian, and got the better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
of him," he said, after picking up his trophies;
"but these will be the proof."</p>

<p>"Let us go on," observed Bob, who had now
finished the labor of recharging his gun.</p>

<p>"Then you do not mean to give up looking
for game?" asked Sandy, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Why should we?" observed his brother,
sturdily. "That Indian has run off, and we
need fear nothing further from him. Perhaps
there is no other within miles of this spot, and
we need fresh meat very much. If my shot
has not frightened everything away, we may
get a chance at a deer yet."</p>

<p>"Perhaps a buffalo!" remarked Sandy,
with eagerness in his voice; for as yet no one
in the company had been successful in shooting
a specimen of those huge, shaggy monsters,
about which they had heard so much, and whose
beaten trails they followed so persistently in
making their way.</p>

<p>They kept on, Bob careful all the while to
observe the direction they took, for he did not
wish to get lost. He was moving up against
the wind, so that even the most suspicious
game might not scent their presence.</p>

<p>"Look! What is that?" whispered Sandy,
as they made their way through a screen of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
bushes, and some bulky object was observed
trotting along ahead.</p>

<p>"A buffalo at last! Get ready, and we will
fire together!" said Bob, trying to stifle his
excitement as he dropped on one knee, the better
to aim his gun.</p>

<p>"Ready? Shoot!"</p>

<p>The two reports sounded almost as one.</p>

<p>"He went down! Oh! we got him!" shrilled
the sanguine one, ready to rush forward.</p>

<p>"Hold on!" Bob quickly cried; "see,
you're mistaken, for he has scrambled to his
feet. Wounded as he is, if he sees us there will
be trouble. There, he is heading this way,
Sandy! Jump for a tree, lad, jump for a
tree!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

<small>ALONG THE BUFFALO TRAIL</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span> jumped according to orders. With
that furious-looking beast coming on the trot,
with lowered, massive head, and uttering savage
bellows as he advanced, no boy would have
hesitated in seeking safety.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 312px;">
<img src="images/i105.jpg" width="312" height="500" alt="large bufflalo chasing man in woods" />
<div class="caption">"SLIPPING ADROITLY AROUND THE BEECH AS FAST AS THE BUFFALO COULD CHASE AFTER HIM."</div>
</div>

<p>Bob swung himself into the lower branches
of the tree under which he chanced to be at
the time the attack came. On the other hand,
Sandy did not understand it in that light. He
expected to use the trunk of a beech as a shield,
behind which he might find shelter from the
bison bull.</p>

<p>Apparently the animal had only sighted
Sandy, since he made direct for the tree back
of which the boy crouched.</p>

<p>"Look out for him, Sandy!" shouted the
occupant of the tree, as he kicked his moccasined
feet, and in other ways tried to attract
to himself the attention of the infuriated beast.</p>

<p>In this he did not seem to be successful, for
the charging bull kept straight on, and came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
up against the trunk of Sandy's refuge with
a thump that staggered him not a little.</p>

<p>"You see what you get!" called the boy,
tauntingly, hovering behind the tree, and ready
to glide around it at the first sign of pursuit.</p>

<p>"Take care, he's going to chase after you!
Keep close to the tree, and be sure you don't
slip!" called Bob; who, his hands trembling
with excitement, was trying to get a charge of
powder into the barrel of his musket, no easy
task while he sat perched on a limb.</p>

<p>Meanwhile there was a scene of action close
by. Sandy showed a clean pair of heels to the
enemy, slipping adroitly around the beech as
fast as the buffalo could chase after him. If
he kept his footing all would be well; but,
should he ever trip on one of the roots that
cropped out of the ground, perhaps the ugly
horns of the beast would gore him before he
could roll out of reach.</p>

<p>So, while he continued to load his gun, Bob
kept up a succession of outcries, intended to
encourage his brother, and at the same time
disconcert the stubborn bison.</p>

<p>"Keep moving, Sandy! Don't let him get
a swipe at you, boy! Oh! I came near dropping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
that bullet then. Will I ever get this gun
loaded? Be careful, lad! That time you were
nearly down. He is tiring, Sandy; but unless
I make haste something dreadful may happen.
I must finish this job. Look out again, he's
meaning to turn on you suddenly. There! just
what I feared; but you were too quick for
him!"</p>

<p>By this time the boy who was spinning
around the tree so rapidly had begun to realize
that it was not so much fun, after all, this being
pursued by a monster with wicked horns, and
the power of a tornado in his thick-set neck.
At times he could almost feel the hot breath
of the animal upon his neck, which showed how
very close the buffalo must be. Had Sandy
chanced to be alone his condition must have
been doubly desperate. As it was, his only
hope seemed to lie in the ability of his brother
to get his gun loaded in time to put an end
to the crazy bison.</p>

<p>"Keep it up just ten seconds longer, Sandy,
and I'll be ready! The priming, boy, that's
all! Now look out, here goes!"</p>

<p>As Bob said this he discharged his musket,
after securing a fair aim, as the animal's flank
came around in full view.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hurrah! he's down again!" gasped poor
Sandy with almost his last breath, for he
seemed on the verge of exhaustion from the
whirl around that tree.</p>

<p>"Climb up out of reach, quick!" shouted
Bob, jumping down so as to attract the attention
of the bull toward himself should the animal
manage to stagger to his legs again, for
he saw his brother was exhausted and would
now prove an easy victim.</p>

<p>But Sandy was on the ground, and he saw
something that his brother did not. The last
bullet had reached a vital spot, and already
the big animal was quivering in the last expiring
throes.</p>

<p>"Get your gun, and load up as fast as you
can!" said Bob, himself suiting the action to
the word.</p>

<p>"But see, he is dead!" expostulated the
other, pointing to the buffalo, which by now
had ceased to struggle and lay quite still.</p>

<p>"Never mind. Load the gun as fast as you
can!" repeated Bob. "A hunter with an
empty shooting-iron is an easy mark for every
prowling redskin. Surely Pat has said that to
us many times. And we now know there are
Indians around here."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus urged, the younger boy hastened to
comply.</p>

<p>"Just to think," he could not help saying,
when this important business had been attended
to, and both of the guns were placed in
shape for further service, "we've actually
brought down a big buffalo. And it is the first
one shot by any of our party. But all the
honor is yours, Bob. If it had been left to me
perhaps the old sinner might have got me. I
was getting blown to a certainty."</p>

<p>"But we can share the honor, Sandy; for
if you had not kept running round and round
as you did, how else could I have shot him?"</p>

<p>That was Bob's generous way, and Sandy
knew it would be utterly useless trying to escape
taking half the credit.</p>

<p>"You watch while I use the knife and take
off the skin," Bob went on; for he knew that
the hide, if properly cured, would make a valuable
robe, to insure warmth when the winter
snows came again. "And watch out for Indians,"
he added suggestively.</p>

<p>These boys had served their apprenticeship
at trapping animals, and there was little in the
science of removing and preserving pelts that
they did not know. So now, while Bob had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
never before seen a dead buffalo, and only had
a glimpse of a live one close at hand, he knew
just how to go to work.</p>

<p>"Plenty of good meat here for the whole
camp," remarked Sandy, with kindling eyes,
as he saw the large buffalo hams exposed by
the removal of the hide.</p>

<p>"Yes, and they say it is fine. If it can beat
that bear we shot early last winter, before all
its fat was gone, I'll be glad we ran across
him," Bob remarked, as he now prepared to
cut the carcass up, so that the best portions
might be reserved.</p>

<p>"I wonder when the folks will be along?"
said the younger lad, allowing his gaze to
travel between the thick trees in that quarter
where it might be expected the pack-horses
would sooner or later appear.</p>

<p>"Listen!" remarked Bob just then, raising
his head, "I thought I heard a shout far
away."</p>

<p>Sandy began to look anxious.</p>

<p>"Oh! I hope nothing has gone wrong," he
observed.</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" expostulated the other,
"what could have happened? Just because
we saw an Indian, and he tried to put an arrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
in one of us, is no sign of danger to the camp.
The only thing that bothers me is that perhaps
they have halted far back there for the night.
In that event, see where we would have to carry
all this meat."</p>

<p>"We might hang it up out of reach of wolves,
and bring some of the men, with a horse, to
tote it in," suggested Sandy.</p>

<p>"That is so, and a clever idea, too. Wait
and see. Perhaps they may come on, and pass
near us here," Bob remarked, "for we are
close to the trail, which I am sure lies over by
that leaning sycamore tree."</p>

<p>So they sat down to wait and listen for more
signs.</p>

<p>"This certainly beats our woods back in
Virginia," remarked Bob, as he looked around
at the great primeval forest that surrounded
them, the trees of tremendous girth and beginning
to show a new crop of bright green
leaves.</p>

<p>"Yes," responded his brother, reflectively,
"it is indeed a wonderful country, and, from
the signs, just overflowing with game. There
was that salt-lick we ran across two days ago;
why, from the marks, thousands of deer and
buffalo must visit it every year. That very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
night we shot three fine stags and a doe, you
remember."</p>

<p>"Yes, and I was sorry we killed that last
one, for she had a little, spotted fawn running
at her heels, and of course it will die, being left
uncared for."</p>

<p>Bob was a true sportsman. He loved to hunt
game, but something within always prevented
him from killing more than he could use. And
that is ever the mark of one who truly loves
Nature. Believing that these good things are
provided by an all-wise Creator for the enjoyment
of man, they look on it as a sin to waste
any such bounties.</p>

<p>"There, that was a shout, and close by, too.
I think it must have been Darby calling to that
lazy beast of his, which wants to lie down in
every little stream we have to ford. Yes, there
he breaks out again," said Sandy.</p>

<p>"And from the row that is going on, and
the laughing, I fear the beast has done what
he's been threatening to do this long while, and
rolled over in a brook. But I can see them now,
over yonder," said Bob, pointing.</p>

<p>Presently the straggling line of pack-horses
came along. When the head man saw what a
fine supply of meat the two young Nimrods had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
awaiting them, he gave the word to pitch
camp.</p>

<p>"The afternoon is going, and we could
hardly find a better spot than right here," he
observed; at which there was a bustle all
around, for camp always meant a period of
ease and rest from the weary tramping over
rough ground.</p>

<p>"But what is that you are carrying,
Sandy?" demanded David Armstrong, as he
came along with his two horses, his wife and
Kate tramping at their side with the steadiness
of squaws, for they had become accustomed to
such vigorous and healthy labor.</p>

<p>"An Indian's bow and arrow which we
picked up after Bob shot and wounded the
owner, who was trying to get me," the boy
quickly replied.</p>

<p>At the word "Indian" others came to stare
at the weapon with curiosity, not unmixed with
alarm, for they knew only too well that now
they had burned their bridges behind them, for
there could be no going back, and every day
carried them further and further into the debatable
country of the Shawanees, which later
on would be known as the "dark and bloody
ground."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />

<small>ATTACKED BY INDIANS</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">It</span> looks as if Pat expected trouble to-night,
Bob."</p>

<p>"Well, the men have been holding a council,
and father says it is best to be on the safe side;
so the guard after this will be doubled."</p>

<p>The two brothers were sitting on the outskirts
of the camp. It did not look like the
cheerful spectacle that up to now had marked
every stopping place on the journey.</p>

<p>A fire had been made late in the afternoon,
and all the cooking done before it grew dark;
then the blaze was allowed to die out. This
had been done through the advice of the Irish
trapper, who knew that the eyes of Indians are
especially keen, and that, when darkness came,
they could see a light like a camp-fire a long
distance off. Even this precaution might not
prevent their being attacked before dawn; but
it was reducing the chances to a minimum.</p>

<p>From where the brothers sat they could just
make out the camp, with the horses quietly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
feeding, and the rude shelters erected to protect
the women and children from the damp
night air. The more hardy men, when not on
duty, were accustomed to dropping down anywhere,
and going to sleep.</p>

<p>On one side several fallen trees had been
formed into a rude sort of rampart, behind
which, in a pinch, the members of the expedition
might find shelter from plunging arrows,
should the worst come.</p>

<p>All these preparations were just what they
had been expecting must come sooner or later.
Nevertheless, they naturally gave the boys considerable
uneasiness, not so much on account
of themselves, as because of those loved ones,
their mother and Kate.</p>

<p>"There are several scouts out, too, to discover
the approach of any hostiles, and bring
warning," remarked Bob.</p>

<p>"Oh! I hope nothing happens," said Sandy,
with a sigh; for, now that they were face to
face with the long-anticipated trouble, somehow
things looked different from when he surveyed
them before leaving that Virginia home
in the valley of the Shenandoah.</p>

<p>"Pat says these redskins are not accustomed
to the sound of firearms," the older boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
continued. "Few among them have guns; and
those have been sold to them by the treacherous
French traders, who are always setting the Indians
on the English."</p>

<p>"Just because they want to have a line of
trading posts stretching between their possessions
up in Canada, and down in Louisiana,"
remarked Sandy, bitterly; for this was a subject
that all the colonists felt deeply; because
the French traders lost no opportunity for
causing ill blood between the Iroquois, Shawanees,
Delawares, Sacs and Pottawatomies on
the one side, and the English on the other.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Bob, "that is supposed to
be the reason. Then, again, these Indian tribes
see the end of their hunting grounds if the palefaces
keep coming across the mountains year
by year, and they will fight. Sooner or later
we must encounter them. Father knew it; yes,
and that is why mother has that sad look in her
eyes."</p>

<p>No longer did the boys belonging to the camp
venture upon any of their sports and games
while the expedition rested for the night. On
other occasions they had wrestled, run races
afoot, and engaged in various small rivalries,
though there had been no shooting at a mark,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
since ammunition was far too valuable to be
thus wasted.</p>

<p>To-night they hung around, listening to the
subdued talk, and imbued with some of the
same spirit that cause the women to huddle
together around their little ones and speak in
hushed voices.</p>

<p>A silence seemed to be upon the very forest
itself, though at this early period in the spring
there were usually few birds moving, and animated
nature had not as yet wholly issued
forth after the winter hibernation, so that this
in itself was not so strange.</p>

<p>"Shall we go in and try to sleep?" asked
Sandy, after two hours had passed with no
alarm being given.</p>

<p>"You might," returned Bob; "but I mean
to stay up as long as I can."</p>

<p>"But, you know, Pat was telling us that
these red men of the west usually attack just
before dawn, when sleep hangs heaviest and
the darkness is strongest!" remarked Sandy,
shrewdly.</p>

<p>"All very true," Bob hastened to say; "but
this once they may see fit to change their tactics.
Besides, I do not feel at all sleepy. You
go in and lie down; but keep your gun close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
beside you, and remember what the orders are
in case of an alarm."</p>

<p>"I have not forgotten. Every man has his
position; and, as we can handle a gun, we count
for the same. But, if you expect to stay right
here, why should I not lie down and sleep under
this tree, as well as in there?"</p>

<p>Bob being unable to advance any plausible
reason why this would not answer, the younger
boy curled himself up in a knot right there on
the bare ground, and inside of five minutes
his regular breathing announced that he was
asleep.</p>

<p>Sitting there, Bob allowed his thoughts to
wander far afield, and of course, in spite of
himself, they went back to the home of his
childhood, to that familiar old cabin under the
wide-spreading oak.</p>

<p>But he had no regrets. The bitterness
caused by the unkind conduct of those one-time
friends and neighbors still swayed him;
and he was glad at the thought of being gone
forever from such unhappy surroundings.</p>

<p>What was that? He certainly had heard a
sound like some one running; and, even as he
started up to listen, a figure brushed past, and
went on into the camp!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Bob's heart began to beat more rapidly. He
knew that this must be one of the scouts. What
news did he bring? Were the Indians about
to descend upon them?</p>

<p>"Wake up, Sandy!" he said, as he laid a
hand on the sleeping boy.</p>

<p>The other sat up, rubbing his eyes as though
hardly understanding where he was; but suddenly
he seemed to comprehend.</p>

<p>"What is it, Bob?" he asked, eagerly, "are
they coming; and must we fight in the dark?"</p>

<p>"I do not exactly know," returned the
other; "only, some one hurried by us, and I
think he brings news. Yes, see, the men are
quietly rising up all around. The signal must
have been given. Come, let us get back into
camp before we are cut off by the enemy."</p>

<p>The two boys soon joined the rest, when they
learned that the scout had indeed brought
startling news. The Indians were coming in
force, and advancing secretly to try to take the
settlers by surprise. At any minute they might
spring up and send a cloud of missiles into the
camp.</p>

<p>All preparations as yet undone must now be
hurriedly looked after. The women and children
were placed behind the shelter of the log<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
rampart. Each, man took the position that had
been marked out for him; then, with bated
breath, they waited for what was coming.</p>

<p>None would ever forget that night! It was
their first real experience with the wily and
treacherous red foe, with whom they were
fated in after years to become so familiar, and
to hate so cordially.</p>

<p>Pat O'Mara was perhaps the only one among
them fully acquainted with the tricky ways of
the redskins; and he had endeavored to put
every man on his guard against being caught
unawares. Besides, he had laid out a shrewd
plan of campaign, by means of which it was
hoped to demoralize the assailants.</p>

<p>After what seemed like an interminable wait
there was a sudden shot. One of those on
guard had possibly caught sight of an enemy
creeping closer to the outskirts of the camp.</p>

<p>It was enough to tell the prowling Indians
that their plans were no secret; for immediately
the forest resounded with their shrill
whoops. They seemed to spring up from every
direction. Seeing their numbers in the faint
light of the stars, the defenders of the camp
might well be excused for feeling new alarm.</p>

<p>Then guns began to sound and to join their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
ringing reports with the awful shouts of the
enemy. The arrows flew like hail, and lucky
the white who had found shelter in time behind
some friendly tree.</p>

<p>It was in this exciting moment that Pat
O'Mara proved his worth.</p>

<p>Above the dreadful clamor his brave Irish
voice rang out, cheering the men on.</p>

<p>"Hurroo! give it till 'em, me byes! Shoot
straight ivery toime, and make each bit av lead
count! Remimber the wimmen and childer, it
is; and knock ivery head ye say!" he kept
shouting, seeming to be everywhere at once.</p>

<p>He had arranged it so that the men fought in
couples. While one fired the other was reloading
his gun; and thus there was always a detail
capable of sending in a volley, should it be
desperately needed.</p>

<p>Bob and Sandy crouched low, doing manful
work, though filled with unspeakable dread lest
the Indians should rush the camp, carrying all
before them.</p>

<p>"Are they retreating, brother?" asked
Sandy at length, after this riot of terrible
sounds had been going on for what seemed an
age.</p>

<p>"I think it must be so," returned Bob,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
hardly able to believe the truth himself.
"Their shouts seem to be further away; and
the arrows have stopped falling!"</p>

<p>"Oh! I wonder what damage has been done,
and if&mdash;" But even the stout-hearted Sandy
dare not voice the fear that was in his soul,
for his thoughts had turned to the beloved
father and the two others who crouched back
of that poor shelter of logs.</p>

<p>Were any of them injured?</p>

<p>"Lights! Start the fire, so that we can see
what damage has been done!" called the leader
of the emigrant band; and almost like magic
tinder was ignited, to be applied to the fires
prepared against this time of need.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />

<small>ON THE BANK OF THE OHIO</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Come</span> with me, Bob!" said the younger
boy, unable to undertake the mission alone.</p>

<p>"Courage!" cried the other in his ear; "I
am sure all is well, and that I heard Kate's
voice in the song of hallelujah that arose from
the women when it was known the Indians had
fled. All must be well, brother!"</p>

<p>Yes, all was well; and in another moment
the boys were encircled in the loving arms of
their anxious mother, while David, bleeding
from a slight wound where an arrow had struck
him, stood by with thanksgiving written on his
bearded face.</p>

<p>If the boys had felt worried about the mother
and Kate, fancy her feelings, knowing as she
did that her loved ones were on the firing line
and taking a thousand risks!</p>

<p>But it was all over now. Pat O'Mara declared
that the red men had received a lesson
they would not soon forget. Doubtless the
valiant little company of home-seekers would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
not be troubled again while on the way to the
Ohio.</p>

<p>They had not come out of the battle entirely
unscathed. True, Heaven had been kind, and
no one had been mortally hurt; but there were
several suffering grievous wounds, who would
have to be tenderly nursed for a time.</p>

<p>"It's lucky for us," declared the redoubtable
Irish trapper, after the extent of the damage
had been discovered, "thot the Shawanees
niver poison their war arrows. Troth, but it
would be a sorry day for the loike av us if thot
same were thrue, as I've knowed some Injuns
to do." And every poor fellow who had received
a more or less painful wound echoed his
words.</p>

<p>When the pioneers came to look around in
the early morning light, expecting to find many
dead Indians, for those guns had poured a hail
of bullets directly into the midst of the onrushing
foe, to their great surprise they failed to
discover a single one. Their dusky comrades
must have crept up in the darkness and removed
both dead and wounded, fearing lest
they fall into the hands of the whites.</p>

<p>It was high noon before the expedition could
get started that day, there were so many things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
to be done toward repairing damages, attending
the wounded, and waiting to hear the report
of scouts sent out to learn whether the
Indians had really left the vicinity.</p>

<p>Satisfied at length that it would be safe to
travel, they made a start. But it might be
noticed that from now on there would be no
long straggling line of burdened horses, strung
out along the buffalo trail. They huddled together
in a bunch, and every man clung to his
gun constantly, while eyes were kept on the
alert for the slightest sign of the cunning
enemy.</p>

<p>Several times there were alarms that sent a
quiver throughout the entire line. Once a
woman discovered a branch moving in a tree,
and was sure that their relentless foes must
have secreted themselves among the sprouting
foliage of the oaks, or amid the dense pines,
ready to drop down upon the little caravan as
it passed.</p>

<p>Forming in a compact mass, with the horses
and women in the centre, and the armed men
circling the whole, they waited until Pat
O'Mara himself crept forward to investigate.
Then it was found that a wildcat had jumped
from one branch to another, causing the swaying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
movement that brought about the
alarm.</p>

<p>Altogether it was a day never to be forgotten.
When night drew near, the leader, after
conferring with the trapper, selected a place
for camping which could readily be defended.
Half an hour's work among the loose rocks,
and the pioneers had constructed quite a
fort.</p>

<p>Bob and his brother worked with the rest;
but both of them keenly felt this new necessity
for being shut up with the others, for they
loved dearly to roam.</p>

<p>"To-morrow, if all is well, we must get out
ahead again," said Sandy, as they watched the
night shades gather around the new camp.</p>

<p>"Pat says there is little danger," added Bob,
reflectively. "He knows these Indians like a
book, and declares that they will not recover
from their licking in a hurry. Besides, we need
not go far away in order to strike game in this
country where it is so plentiful."</p>

<p>"It looks as if they meant to keep the fires
going to-night."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is to show the enemy that we do
not fear them. Pat says you can cow Indians
by appearing to have a contempt for them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Once let them believe you are <i>afraid</i> and they
will be very brave. Besides, you know we have
men out yonder watching. No danger of a
surprise to-night. Every trail is guarded."</p>

<p>"Well, it looks more cheerful, I must say,"
declared Sandy; "and there is surely something
in what Pat says. Who knows the ways
of these redskins better than he? Twice has
he been with Colonel Boone, far down in the
regions of the Kentucky River. I would trust
his word in anything."</p>

<p>"He seems to be everywhere, and hardly
sleeps. But," and Bob sighed as he spoke, "I
know I shall be glad, for one, when we reach
the spot where we mean to make our new home,
and can build a cabin to cover the heads of
mother and Kate."</p>

<p>"Just what I was thinking," echoed the
younger lad. "After all, there is nothing like
home, no matter if it be in Virginia or in the
wilderness, so long as <i>she</i> is there. But, oh!
listen! Is that not the signal agreed upon with
the sentinels out in the timber? Can the enemy
be coming down on us now?"</p>

<p>"Impossible," said Bob, after listening intently.
"According to all we have ever heard
about their ways they do not make an attack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
before late in the night, and never at dusk. It
must mean something else."</p>

<p>"But there it goes again, and closer. One
of the men is coming in. Perhaps he does not
wish to take chances of being fired upon by
some hasty fellow."</p>

<p>"Now I hear voices," declared Bob, raising
his hand, "and some of them do not sound familiar,
though they speak good English. Oh!
I wonder if it can be&mdash;look at Pat hurrying
forward, and see how his face is covered with
a broad grin! Brother, it must be he recognized
a familiar sound in&mdash;Look, several men
are coming, and they are hunters, too!"</p>

<p>"That one in front, Bob, with the bold air&mdash;I
have not forgotten that Pat told us how
one man he knew seemed born to command.
Did you ever see a face like that? It is,&mdash;it
must be Colonel Boone himself!"</p>

<p>All was now excitement in the emigrant
camp. Dogs barked, horses neighed, men
shouted, and women laughed; while children
added their shrill cries to the general clamor.
Just the coming of five men clad in buckskin
had caused this uproar; but such men!</p>

<p>"Come!" cried Sandy, seizing hold of his
brother by the sleeve. "Let us go forward and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
meet them. See, there is father shaking hands
with Colonel Boone, just as if he had known
him before. And look at Pat dancing around
like a crazy man! Did you ever know him to
be so happy? Now we shall surely reach the
Ohio without being set upon again by the red
men."</p>

<p>It was a period of great rejoicing. Daniel
Boone (<a href="#Note_5">Note 5</a>) and his fellow hunters were
once more on their way to the region where the
great pioneer had determined to locate his future
home, in the heart of the country below
the Ohio, and to be known later on as Kentucky.</p>

<p>As the hunters had not supped, the women
were soon employed getting them a good meal.
Meanwhile the story of the recent fight was
told.</p>

<p>But there was little that was new to these
readers of Indian signs; for they had passed
over the scene of the fight just a few hours
back, and, not finding any signs of fresh graves,
knew that death could not have visited the pioneers.</p>

<p>Both Bob and Sandy felt proud to shake the
hand of the man of whom they had heard so
much from the Irish trapper; and, when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
looked into his bold face, with its wonderfully
magnetic eyes, they understood how it was that
Colonel Boone had such a strange influence
with the Indians along the Ohio.</p>

<p>"He has promised to stay wid us until we
reach the river," said Pat O'Mara, as he joined
the Armstrong family a little later, as they
were comparing notes.</p>

<p>"And the others also?" asked David. "Daviess,
Hardin, Harlan and the young man,
Simon Kenton (<a href="#Note_6">Note 6</a>), of whom Boone seems
to be so fond, will they also remain in our
company that long?"</p>

<p>"Sure they will," replied the trapper,
quickly, "an' only too glad av the chanct. It
isn't often they happens to run acrost white
paple in this blissed wilderness. The sight av
a lady must be a plisure till men as are exiled
from home. Sure they mane to stay by us.
And by the same token 'tis little we nade fear
from the pesky rid varmints after this."</p>

<p>It seemed to Sandy that he could not sleep,
much as he was in need of rest after the wakefulness
of the previous night. He hovered
around wherever Colonel Boone chanced to be,
listening to his musical voice, and hanging upon
his words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>The forest rangers were all dressed pretty
much alike, after the custom in vogue at that
day. The outside garment was a hunting shirt,
or loose open frock, made of tanned deerskins.
Leggins of the same material covered the lower
limbs, fancifully fringed along the outside
seam; the collar, or cape, of the shirt was also
fringed. The feet were clad in beaded moccasins,
no doubt made in some Indian wigwam.</p>

<p>Each man carried a hatchet or tomahawk
suspended from his belt, while a keen-edged
hunting knife reposed in a leather sheath. Besides,
there were a powder-horn, bullet-pouch,
and a little bag containing tinder, flint and
steel, and such indispensables as a nomad, wandering
day by day through unknown forests,
would need for his comfort.</p>

<p>Sandy, even after he was induced to lie under
a blanket, kept watching the imposing figure
of Boone, as he moved about the camp. It was
a plain case of hero worship on the boy's part.
He had heard so much about this wonderful
man, and now that he had seen him there was
not the least disappointment connected with
the reality.</p>

<p>Finally Sandy fell asleep, his last thought
being a sincere wish that some day he too might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
possess a portion of the power over men that
was given to Daniel Boone.</p>

<p>It was morning when the boy awoke. There
had been no alarm during the night, and Pat
O'Mara's prediction concerning the Indians
seemed coming true. The defeat they had received
at the hands of the whites had cowed
them for the time being, though of course no
one was so simple as to believe that this state
of affairs, however pleasant it might seem,
would last long.</p>

<p>An early start was made, for they had high
hopes that they might arrive at the bank of the
mighty Ohio River before another night.</p>

<p>"If you put your best foot forward," Boone
had told them the previous night, as he conferred
with Pat and the leading spirits in the
camp, "it may be possible to look upon the
Ohio before dark sets in again. Jo Daviess
here, who has a better knowledge of distances
than the rest of us, since he has been a surveyor,
tells me it can be done. And I have
never known him to make a mistake."</p>

<p>That day marked a vast difference in the
attitude of the pioneers. No longer did they
huddle together like a hunch of scared quail,
anticipating trouble from every quarter. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
very presence of those five experienced hunters
and Indian fighters seemed a tower of strength
to them.</p>

<p>Sandy and his brother took advantage of the
opportunity to resume their usual hunting expedition,
and managed to bring down a fine
five-pronged buck that was a welcome addition
to the larder.</p>

<p>It was about four in the afternoon, as told
by the sun in the western heavens, for none of
them had any other means of ascertaining the
flight of time, when, passing through an unusually
dense patch of timber, the pioneers came
out upon a high bank, and saw a sight that
tingled their blood.</p>

<p>Before them flowed a majestic stream,
wooded down to the edge of the water, and
with the westering sun gilding the little wavelets
until they seemed tipped with gold. It was
the sublime Ohio, at that time the most beautiful
of streams, for its hilly shores were covered
with the virgin forest.</p>

<p>Loud rang the cheers from that little band
of pioneers.</p>

<p>The Armstrongs' long and arduous journey
was at an end. Somewhere along the river
they would select the spot upon which to erect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
their cabin. The surrounding country fairly
teemed with game; and, if the Indians would
only leave them in peace, they had reason to
believe that in this wilderness they might find
the haven for which they sighed when leaving
their Virginia home.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />

<small>BOONE, THE CAPTAIN OF PIONEERS</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">That</span> night the hunters passed again with
the settlers. On the following morning it was
the intention of Boone and his companions to
start further west; for the lure of Kentucky
was in his veins, and he felt that no other place
could satisfy him, after having once seen that
rich soil and hunted in the majestic woods
along the Kentucky River.</p>

<p>Before leaving the pioneers the mighty
hunter gave them much good advice. He knew
of a very desirable plateau just a few miles
further west, looking out upon the river, where
he himself would locate if he had not already
decided on a site on the Kentucky River; and
here he hoped they would settle.</p>

<p>Bob and Sandy had decided that they would
accompany the hunters a little way when they
left. They wished to see as much of them as
possible, and, besides, it was down the river the
rest would soon be coming, in search of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
spot marked out by the discerning eye of
Boone.</p>

<p>"Glad to have your company, lads," said
Daniel Boone, when Bob made the request,
"for I have taken much interest in both of you.
Friend Armstrong is a lucky man to have his
family with him from the start," and he sighed
slightly, for it had been so fated that in much
of his pioneer work Boone was compelled to
be separated from those he loved.</p>

<p>That was a morning those lads would never
forget as long as they lived. Side by side they
walked with the man who knew more about Indian
craftiness than any other along the entire
frontier; and in his own pleasant way Boone
gave the boys much valuable advice.</p>

<p>"Always keep a charge in your gun if possible,"
he said, "and sleep with one eye open,
when you have reason to believe there are Indians
around; for, next to a cat, I believe the
red varmints to be the trickiest things in all
creation. But here we are at the spot I picked
out for your settlement. It would not be wise
for you to go any further, lads. What do you
think of my choice? Do you believe you can
make a happy home here?"</p>

<p>When they looked around, and noted the natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
beauty of the location, commanding a fine
view of the river as it did, the two boys were
loud in its praise.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you like it," observed Boone;
"for the first time I struck this place I determined
that some day it must be covered with
the homes of white men. Once an Indian village
stood here, and why they moved away I
never learned; but you will find many signs
where their lodges stood, and there are burial
places back in the hills."</p>

<p>"Must you go now, Colonel Boone?" asked
Bob, who felt a sense of keen regret because
their pleasant relations must be severed so
soon.</p>

<p>"It is necessary that we lose no more time,"
came the reply; "already I fear that some
who await us far beyond may be in difficulties,
for the Indians were beginning to grow troublesome
at the time I left. But we will come
again. Here we shall hope to find a warm welcome
when passing back and forth."</p>

<p>So the boys shook hands with each of the five
buckskin-clad rangers. The young man, Simon
Kenton, had interested them very much.</p>

<p>"He has the making of a second Colonel
Boone in him," Bob said, as his eyes followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
the little band of pioneers, walking along in
Indian file, with Kenton bringing up the rear;
"I wish he would only take a notion to join
his fortunes with us here."</p>

<p>Then the figures of the five were hidden in
the dense undergrowth. The last they saw of
Daniel Boone was when he turned, before plunging
into the thicket, to wave a hand to them
in good-bye.</p>

<p>"What shall we do now?" asked Sandy,
rather gloomily; for somehow he seemed to
feel the departure of these valiant frontiersmen
keenly, though he had only known them
such a brief time.</p>

<p>"Stay around here until our folks come.
We promised Colonel Boone not to follow after
him, you remember," returned Bob, with whom
his word was as good as his bond.</p>

<p>"But that may not be for some hours," protested
the impatient Sandy; "because, you
know, they were not near ready to start when
we left camp; and then they will move much
slower than we did, led by men who know every
trail."</p>

<p>"But it ought to be enough for us to just
sit here and look out on that grand river,"
remarked Bob, admiration in his eyes, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
turned them upon the silently flowing stream,
still bank-full from the spring rains.</p>

<p>"It is a fine sight, I'm ready to say," Sandy
admitted; "and after we get a cabin built we
ought to be mighty well contented here, with
fish to be had for the taking at the door, and
game coming up almost asking to be shot."</p>

<p>"Think of the use for our traps back in those
wooded hills. Why, I wager we shall lay in a
store of pelts the first winter five times as great
as ever happened in Virginia. But how glad
I am the dreadful journey is done. Kate and
mother both stood it better than father expected.
How brave they are, and what a blessing
it is to have such a mother and sister."</p>

<p>Bob's eyes filled while he was speaking; but
they were tears of gratitude, not sorrow.</p>

<p>Sitting there, and gazing as if fascinated out
upon the broad and majestic stream which from
this time on was fated to enter so deeply into
their new life, Bob did not notice that his
younger brother was wandering around the
place. Sandy had always been as curious as
any woman, and this propensity had more than
a few times brought him face to face with
trouble.</p>

<p>It was perhaps half an hour after the five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
hunters had left them when Bob suddenly
aroused to the fact that for some time he had
not heard anything from his brother.</p>

<p>"I wonder where he can be?" he said to
himself a little anxiously as he scrambled to his
feet to glance around. "Strange that he is
not in sight. Perhaps after all he did lie
down, and in this warm sunshine has gone to
sleep."</p>

<p>The idea pleased him, and he started to
search for some sign of the missing one.</p>

<p>Three minutes, five passed, and still he had
not discovered Sandy. He had not as yet
called, thinking that there was no need.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I can track him," Bob said to himself,
as he once more reached the spot where he
had been reclining.</p>

<p>It was not very difficult to ascertain where
the footprints of his brother made a distinct
trail, for, although Sandy wore moccasins, the
soil was soft, and he had not been at any pains
to hide his tracks.</p>

<p>So Bob moved along, to the right and to the
left, just as Sandy had happened to make his
way when investigating the site for the proposed
settlement. Thus by slow degrees he
found himself doubling on their own trail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>At discovering this Bob smiled.</p>

<p>"I think I can see now," he remarked.
"While we promised Colonel Boone not to go
any further than this, nothing was said about
the back country. And Sandy has been unable
to resist the temptation to wander around,
looking for game. But he could not have found
anything worth while, or surely I should have
heard a gun-shot. Perhaps I had better give
him a hail."</p>

<p>So saying he raised his hand to his mouth,
after a fashion which they had long followed
when in the woods, or following their line of
traps, and immediately through the woods
rang his shout:</p>

<p>"Ho! Sandy! Hello!"</p>

<p>To his astonishment a voice immediately answered,
and he saw his brother advancing hurriedly
toward him. But he carried no game;
and no sooner had Bob set eyes upon the other's
face than he realized that Sandy brought
news of some sort, for he looked excited.</p>

<p>"What is it,&mdash;Indians?" asked the older
boy, involuntarily half raising his musket, and
casting an apprehensive glance around at the
frowning and mysterious forest by which they
were almost entirely surrounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>But Sandy shook his head in the negative,
much to the relief of his brother.</p>

<p>"Then have you found a bear's den, or perhaps
a wolf's whelps?" he went on.</p>

<p>"You would never guess it in a week, Bob,"
declared Sandy, with a smile; "but come with
me. I am sure you can do him good, with your
knowledge of surgery, which is going to make
you a wonderful man some fine day."</p>

<p>"Surgery! What have you found, Sandy?
Is there any one wounded near here?"</p>

<p>Sandy nodded his head.</p>

<p>"Yes, and pretty badly hurt, I fear."</p>

<p>"Not a white man, surely?" went on the
other, falling into step with the impatient one.</p>

<p>"It is an Indian," replied Sandy, soberly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps one of those who were wounded
in the fight. He may have come thus far on
his way to his village, and given out," and now
it was Bob who urged the pace, for his professional
instinct had been aroused.</p>

<p>True, it was only an Indian who was injured,
and in those days the settlers on the frontiers
had a very low estimation of the red man as
a human being. But then Bob was a boy, and
his love for relieving pain amounted almost to
a mania with him. Many a time had he set the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
broken limb of some little wild animal, across
which he had accidentally come in the forest;
and his operations had always been very successful;
so much so that both father and
mother were proud of him.</p>

<p>Sandy had apparently taken particular notice
of the place where he had found the injured
Indian, for he seemed to experience no
trouble in leading the way back there.</p>

<p>"Here he is," he suddenly remarked, as he
swept aside a screen of pawpaws.</p>

<p>Bob looked down upon a painted face, and
felt a pair of glittering black eyes fastened intently
upon him.</p>

<p>"Why, he is a young fellow, hardly more
than a boy," he remarked in some surprise;
but his words must have been understood by
the wounded one, for he tried to draw his slender
figure up in pride.</p>

<p>"Me brave&mdash;me Blue Jacket!" he said, almost
fiercely, smiting himself several times on
the chest.</p>

<p>The peculiar name caused Bob to notice for
the first time that the young Indian was indeed
wearing a hunting shirt fancifully decked with
the quills of the blue-jay, and from which he
doubtless took his name, although in the Indian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
tongue it would probably be of an altogether
unpronounceable nature.</p>

<p>The Indian did not wholly trust them, it was
plain to be seen. Unable to fight, he seemed
ready to stoically meet his fate without a whimper,
for, perhaps, he fully expected these enemies
to knock him on the head, because it was
evident from the nature of his wound that he
had been in the recent engagement.</p>

<p>"Let me look at your hurt, Blue Jacket,"
said Bob, bending down over the recumbent
figure.</p>

<p>The other set his teeth hard, but beyond a
grunt gave no sign, while the white lad carefully
drew away the cloth which was tied about
the leg in which a bullet had become imbedded.</p>

<p>In some way the wounded brave must have
become separated from his fellows, and, while
trying to get to his village alone, had fallen
here through weakness caused by the loss of
blood.</p>

<p>"He would have been dead by morning if
some one had not found him," declared Bob as
he started to cleanse the wound as well as possible
just then, meaning to repeat the operation
when he could have warm water in plenty.</p>

<p>Those beady eyes followed each gentle action<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
with perplexity that gradually grew into
confidence. Blue Jacket was learning a new
lesson in warfare. His savage conception of
how a fallen enemy should be treated had received
a rude jolt.</p>

<p>"Here, Sandy," said the young surgeon,
presently, "take hold of his feet, and we will
carry him over to where we expect to camp
on the site of the coming settlement. The poor
fellow shall not die if I can help it. You found
him, and he belongs to us. Remember that, if
anybody wants to do him an injury. Pat will
stand by us, I'm sure; and mother must, for
has she not always told us we should do good
even to them that persecute us. Now, gently,
Sandy. An Indian can suffer, if he does refuse
to show it."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />

<small>BLUE JACKET</small></h2>


<p>"How will this place do?" asked Bob, coming
to a halt, and the boys gently lowered their
burden to the ground.</p>

<p>"Just the place where I'd like to see our
cabin raised, with that fine view of the river
up and down," declared the other, enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"And that is why I chose it," answered Bob
with a smile. "If we are already at work here,
father and mother will naturally come along
to us, and the thing is done without any
fuss."</p>

<p>The young Indian had not said a single word
since making the assertion that his name was
Blue Jacket, and that he was a brave, not a
boy.</p>

<p>Those keen black eyes had observed all that
the Armstrong lads did with an ever-increasing
knowledge of what it meant. There was something
in their manner of handling him that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
spoke louder than words to the wild heart of
this child of the forest; and already he had
begun to feel confidence in them.</p>

<p>"Now, start a blaze as soon as you like,
Sandy. By the time they get here the fire will
be good and hot, so that water will heat in a
jiffy."</p>

<p>They had made the wounded Indian as comfortable
as possible; and he lay there, apparently
content to watch them work. Possibly he
expected that, when the white men, against
whom his hand had so recently been raised,
should arrive on the scene, his fate must be a
matter of minutes; but an Indian never shows
emotion, and fear, in his eyes, is the symptom
of a coward.</p>

<p>Sandy immediately gathered some wood. He
had had long experience in making fires, and
gloried in the opportunity to show his skill.</p>

<p>"There, how does that look?" he demanded
presently, when, after having used his flint and
steel with good results, the flying sparks
quickly caught in the dry tinder, and flames
began to creep up amidst the gathered wood.</p>

<p>"As fine as the finest," returned his brother,
who knew Sandy's weakness, and never let a
chance to cater to it pass by; "and unless my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
ears deceive me I think I heard voices just then
up-river."</p>

<p>"You are right, brother," declared the
younger lad, pointing; "for there they come,
with Pat O'Mara, bless his heart, at the head
of the line."</p>

<p>The wounded Indian never even started, and
yet a quiver of alarm must certainly have
passed through his agonized frame. He simply
turned his gaze toward the setting sun, as
though, if the worst came, he wished to feast
his eyes for the last time on that glorious spectacle.
For the clouds floating in space had
begun to take on a most gorgeous tint, as though
the mysterious unknown country beyond might
be putting on a holiday dress to welcome him
to the Happy Hunting Grounds of the red
man.</p>

<p>Then the long line of horses and pioneers arrived
on the spot that had been picked out by
Colonel Boone as the prettiest site for a settlement
he knew of along the upper Ohio.</p>

<p>Various exclamations of rapture and delight
broke forth. The magical beauty of the scene
overpowered all alike. Men and women stood
there, drinking in the river view as seen in the
fading light of the sun; and, when they turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
to exchange sentiments, they were unanimously
favorable.</p>

<p>"It is Paradise!" cried one woman, who had
suffered greatly during the long pilgrimage
across mountains and wilderness.</p>

<p>Pat O'Mara was the happiest of the whole
group. He did not expect to put up a cabin
home, for his nature compelled him to be a
rover; but, since he had guided these pioneers
along the way into the Promised Land, naturally
he felt elated because they were thrilled
and pleased with their new homeland.</p>

<p>And then again, Pat had the greatest admiration
for that chief of pioneers, Daniel Boone,
who had selected this site as the proper spot
for a future white man's town.</p>

<p>"Now, plase lave all thot till another day,"
he called out, presently; "and pay attintion
till the juties av the hour. Sure, they be fires
to sthart, fuel to chop, and some protiction to
be made aginst an attack av the rids. To worrk
thin, iverybody!"</p>

<p>Seeing their two boys standing at a certain
point, David Armstrong, his good wife, and
Kate, leading the two horses, made toward
them. From the fact that there was already
quite a heap of firewood piled up they took it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
for granted that Bob wished them to camp
on that particular spot for some reason or
other.</p>

<p>Suddenly Kate gave utterance to a bubbling
cry of alarm.</p>

<p>"What is it!" demanded her father, startled,
since he could only imagine that the young
girl might have turned her ankle at just the
last stage of their long journey.</p>

<p>"Look behind the boys, father! An Indian!"
she exclaimed, pointing a trembling
finger toward Bob.</p>

<p>David, too, discovered the form just at that
moment, and was also visibly disturbed. But
he noticed that both boys were showing not the
least sign of any alarm, and from that understood
there could be no danger.</p>

<p>Perhaps, also, his renewed confidence arose
from the fact that the Indian was lying on his
back, and not in the act of creeping forward,
as if intent on sinking his tomahawk into the
bodies of the lads.</p>

<p>"What is this, Bob, Sandy?" he asked, as
he stood over the form of the Shawanee, who
met his gaze without a flicker of emotion.</p>

<p>"We found the poor fellow near by, father.
He is wounded, and was slowly bleeding to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
death," said Bob hastily, and not a little anxiously.</p>

<p>"And Bob couldn't keep from helping him;
you know his failing, father. What we want
now is a kettle in which to heat some water,"
remarked Sandy, making a movement to secure
the implement he had in mind, and which, in
company with other cooking utensils, dangled
from the back of the leading horse.</p>

<p>"Stop! what is this you mean to do?"
asked David Armstrong uneasily.</p>

<p>"Save the poor fellow's life, perhaps. He
has an even chance if I can cleanse that ugly
wound," replied Bob, meeting his father's eye
steadily.</p>

<p>"But he must have been one of those savages
who tried to rush our camp night before
last; the wound is from one of our own bullets!"
David went on, shaking his head, as
though he did not wholly believe it right they
should nurse a viper only to have him sting
them.</p>

<p>Bob looked appealingly at his mother. Well
he knew where to go for backing in a case like
this; nor did he make any mistake.</p>

<p>"David, for shame! Would you let the poor
boy die, even though his skin be different from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
ours? Do we learn this in the Good Book?
Is it not written that we bind up the hurts of
our enemies, and thus cover their heads with
ashes of reproach? What if it were one of our
dear lads, in an Indian village&mdash;would you
wish him to be treated like a dog? We have
come here to live, and it becomes us to set a
Christian example to these poor heathen."</p>

<p>David Armstrong was far from being a hard
man at heart. Like most of the early pioneers
he had imbibed strong ideas concerning the
heroic measures necessary to hold their own
against the grievous perils that menaced them
on every side. And, doubtless, he, in common
with most of the men in the ranks of those who
invaded the wilderness, believed that the "only
good Indian was a dead Indian." But, as
always, he was dominated by the sweet influence
of his gentle wife.</p>

<p>"Boys, your mother knows best," he said,
presently; "and it is better that you take pattern
from her, than follow in my footsteps.
Do what you think is right, and we will hope
no evil follows."</p>

<p>Of course the young Indian had listened to
all this talk closely. He might not understand
what sentiment influenced the wife and mother;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
but he could see the noble pity that shone in
her eyes as she bent above him.</p>

<p>Still, not by the slightest expression did he
betray any satisfaction that may have passed
through his heart at the knowledge that he was
not to be ruthlessly put to death as he had anticipated.
That would have ill become a warrior,
which, boy though he seemed to be, he had
so proudly proclaimed himself.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Sandy made his way down to the
edge of the flowing river and filled his kettle
with water which he placed upon the stones
composing the rude but effective fireplace. It
would only take five or ten minutes to heat this
sufficiently for the purpose of the amateur surgeon.</p>

<p>David busied himself relieving the animals
of their several loads, in which both Bob and
Kate assisted. Rude shelters in the shape of
tents would have to serve them for the present,
until cabins could be provided; but, ere another
sun set, the chances were that several houses
would be started, for these pioneers were quick
workers, once they set their shoulders to anything.</p>

<p>Bob knew that no time should be lost in washing
that inflamed wound, and applying some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the wholesome soothing lotion which his mother
prided herself in making. Well he knew its
wonderful properties in a case of this kind, and
he believed that it would allay the dangerous
stage of that injury as nothing else might,
hence his desire to make haste in applying it.
The others could in the meantime be erecting
the tent and gathering their scanty household
goods under its friendly shelter.</p>

<p>When he found the water warm enough for
his purpose he went to work. Most of the pioneers
were too busily engaged just then in settling
on locations for the night to bother hanging
around to see what occupied the attention
of the Armstrong lads; but, of course, the
smaller children quickly discovered the presence
of a real Indian in the camp, and the news
speedily circulated around.</p>

<p>Pat O'Mara himself came over to assist his
particular friends, and when he saw what task
was being done his eyes opened round with
wonder.</p>

<p>"Begorra! an' is it a horsepital ye've
stharted already, Bob?" he asked, as he leaned
over to look, and then started at seeing a copper-colored
face with a pair of snapping black
eyes fastened defiantly on his own countenance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
"Phat! a ridskin it is ye are afther
havin' here? Sure, it's the first toime
I iver saw a white lad nurse a sick Injun
bye!"</p>

<p>When the prospect of death itself could not
induce the Shawanee to show signs of emotion,
this likening him to a youth, as in the previous
instance, seemed to arouse him. An Indian
hates above all things to be called a squaw
or a child. He sat up, despite the restraining
hand of Bob, and smote himself proudly
on the chest, once again exclaiming angrily:</p>

<p>"Blue Jacket, him no boy&mdash;warrior&mdash;big
brave, ugh!"</p>

<p>"Well," remarked Pat with a quizzical smile,
"I reckons as how what ye sez is all quite
thrue, Blue Jacket. And if so be this foine lad
chooses to coddle yees back to loife agin, phat
business is it av ours? On'y it sames till me
'tis a great waste av toime an' liniment. But,
Bob, look out ye don't lose yer patient,
lad."</p>

<p>"Lose him, Pat?" echoed the other, pausing
in the act of binding up the limb, after having
used the precious, magical ointment given to
him by his mother. "What can you mean? I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
feel sure he'll come around all right. He's
young, and with good blood in his veins. Surely
the chances are ten to one&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bob stopped right there. Suddenly he comprehended
what the kindly Irish trapper meant,
when he spoke in that way. Following the
meaning look of the other he saw that a man
was hurriedly approaching them. He carried
a gun in his hand, and there was an ugly expression
on his bearded face.</p>

<p>This man was a pioneer named Brady. He
had come from the section of Carolina where
the Boone family had lived, and was meaning
to hew himself a new home in the great western
wilderness.</p>

<p>Anthony Brady was the father of a family,
and a fair sample of the early pioneer, but he
hated Indians above all living things, looking
upon them as only fit to be shot and hewed down
whenever possible.</p>

<p>Bob knew that Anthony had had a brother
dangerously wounded in that warm engagement
when the Shawanees attempted to carry the
camp. This must have aggravated Brady's
already bitter feeling for the red men, and,
hearing that the Armstrong boys were meaning
to nurse one of the wounded foemen back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
life, he was filled with rage that such a thing
should ever be allowed.</p>

<p>And Bob felt that Blue Jacket was in more
peril right then than when he lay on the ground,
weakened by his wound, and left to perish.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />

<small>A NEW HOME IN THE WILDERNESS</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Sandy!</span>"</p>

<p>The younger lad heard his name called and,
looking up, caught the beckoning finger of his
brother. One look told him what was threatening,
for the face of the advancing settler betrayed
the ugly thoughts that filled his mind.</p>

<p>Sandy immediately sprang over to join
forces with his brother, for whatever Bob did
was right, in his mind, and he stood ready to
back him up to the end.</p>

<p>"What does all this foolishness mean?" demanded
the tall pioneer as he came to where
Bob was still kneeling beside his patient, with
the bandage just secured by a strip of narrow
linen which his mother was never without, since
every housewife in those days had to be ready
for emergencies.</p>

<p>Bob did not answer. He waited until Mr.
Brady saw the young Indian, who met the
angry glare in the settler's eyes with a defiant
look. Blue Jacket even hastened to sit up, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
fold his sinewy arms across his chest. It was
the attitude which he conceived a true warrior
ought to assume when ready to chant his death
song, and laugh at Fate.</p>

<p>"An Injun!" roared the furious man, making
a threatening movement with his long
musket. "They told me so, but I couldn't
hardly believe it. A red viper in our camp, to
be nursed back to life so that he can bring
his fellows down on us some fine night, and
scalp the whole company. We'll soon settle
that!"</p>

<p>"Hold on, Mr. Brady," said Bob calmly.
"What do you mean to do?"</p>

<p>He had placed himself in front of the
wounded Indian, shielding his painted body
with his own. Sandy stood close at hand, ready
to clutch the arm of the infuriated man should
he dare venture to extremes. And Mr. Armstrong
came hurrying up, urged on by his
alarmed wife.</p>

<p>"Shoot the snake as he deserves, if you must
know!" shouted the man, who had worked himself
up into a condition bordering on hysteria.
"Who knows but what it was him that wounded
my poor brother, Caleb! One Injun more or
less can never matter much, anyway. So stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
aside, Bob Armstrong, and let me put him out
of his misery, like you would a mad dog."</p>

<p>But he greatly mistook the temper of Bob,
if he thought that threats like this could have
any influence over him. On the contrary the
young pioneer only spread himself more
squarely in front of his helpless charge.</p>

<p>"No, you shall not hurt him, Mr. Brady.
Sandy and I found him, and he belongs to us.
Pat O'Mara is still in charge of this company,
and he has told us we could do what we wanted
with him. Besides, he is only one lone Indian,
and can do us no harm. Perhaps, if we help
him now, he may not forget it some time in
the future. For we are come here to stay always,
and his people belong here."</p>

<p>The man dared not attempt to fire while Bob
thus interposed his body between; besides, he
had a healthy respect for the redoubtable Irish
trapper.</p>

<p>"Is that true, O'Mara?" he demanded.
"Have you given these foolish lads permission
to keep this varmint alive when he's better off
if dispatched?"</p>

<p>"'Tis a fact that they prejudiced me in favor
av thot same ijee, aven though I was opposed to
the same in the sthart," responded the genial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Pat, winking at Sandy while he spoke. "And
p'raps it's best thot ye do be mindin' yer own
business, Mr. Brady, meanin' no offence at
all."</p>

<p>"And," said David, laying a heavy hand on
the other's shoulder, "they have the approval
of both their mother and myself, Brady, so
please pay no more attention to what we are
doing here. The redskin will be able to travel
in a few days. Perhaps he may take a message
to his people from us, and be the means of
bringing about a lasting truce&mdash;who knows?
At all events he is going to be doctored by Robert,
and no one will lay a finger on him without
accounting to me!"</p>

<p>Anthony Brady was no fool, though doubtless
a most impulsive man. He knew that the
conditions were most unfavorable for a continuance
of the argument, so, shrugging his
broad shoulders, and with a last scowl at the
impassive face of the young Shawanee brave,
he turned on his heel in disgust.</p>

<p>"Well, have your way, Armstrong," he said,
moodily. "But, if I happen to run across this
young savage in the forest, he will never return
to his people to tattle about our weakness."</p>

<p>"And if you attempt any treachery, Brady,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
you will answer to me for it, remember," declared
David, sternly.</p>

<p>"An' to me, by the pipers!" echoed O'Mara,
shaking his head aggressively.</p>

<p>"Have no fear as long as he is in your
charge, neighbor, for I am not the man to stir
up strife over one wretched Injun; but, after
he <i>leaves</i> you the case is different, and he can
be safely potted by any white with a ready
gun," and with this dark threat Brady stalked
away.</p>

<p>And the one who had been the cause for all
this excitement did not utter a single word to
show that he understood what a world of gratitude
he owed to the two boys. But there was
a look of intelligence in his face. He understood,
and would not forget.</p>

<p>The night was now gathering around them.
Fires had been started, and every soul in the
new settlement seemed to be busily engaged.</p>

<p>Already had the Armstrong tent been raised,
and things were assuming rather a cheery look
around them. And, while they worked, many
times did the eyes of those pioneers wander
down to the placid surface of that broad and
swift river, concerning which they had heard
such extravagant tales.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>Supper was presently ready. It consisted of
the simplest of fare, for luxuries were utterly
unknown among these early settlers along the
Ohio; but there was plenty and to spare, and
their good wives knew how to cook it in an
appetizing manner.</p>

<p>Nor was the young Indian forgotten. He
sat up and ate in silence. Not one word did
he speak to express any gratitude, save when
he was through, and ready to lie back again, at
which time he gave a grunt, and remarked:</p>

<p>"Ugh! good!"</p>

<p>"I guess he doesn't know much English,"
observed Sandy, chuckling.</p>

<p>"That may be," replied his brother; "but
I've heard Pat say that these Indians never tell
what they think. I reckon he <i>feels</i> it all right,
for I can see something in those snapping black
eyes of his that tells me so every time he looks
at either of us."</p>

<p>"Yes, and you in particular, Bob," declared
Sandy; "because he just can't understand
why you treat him so fine, when he expected to
be knocked on the head, like we do a lynx or
a fox we find in our traps."</p>

<p>The customary precautions were taken that
night to guard against a surprise. The gloomy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
mysterious forest surrounded them on every
side save the river, and who could say what
terrible perils it concealed? Here roved fierce
beasts of prey, the bear, the panther, and the
wolf, besides possibly other species of animals
the nature of which they did not know.</p>

<p>But still more to be feared ten times over
were those dusky hordes of savages, whose
country they had invaded, if not with hostile
intent, at least meaning to take it for the use
of the white man.</p>

<p>But there was no night alarm. Doubtless
more than one among the women trembled as
she lay awake during that first night on the
bank of the Ohio, and listened to various sounds
from the forest that might not be familiar to
her ears, and which her fears magnified into
signals exchanged between different parties of
prowling Indians waiting for a chance to attack
the intruders.</p>

<p>But morning dawned, bright and rosy, and
all was well.</p>

<p>Bob had slept close to where his patient lay
on a spare blanket. He entertained some anxiety
lest Brady, or another of the same stripe,
might deem it a duty to creep up in the darkness
and finish the wounded Indian. Perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
he did the man an injustice in suspecting anything
of the sort; but Bob had inherited his
forefathers' Scotch caution.</p>

<p>All was soon animation. While the women
prepared breakfast the hardy men selected the
sites upon which they expected to begin erecting
their future cabin homes.</p>

<p>The Armstrongs were able to retain possession
of the spot which had so pleased the boys,
and David had even marked the dimensions of
his new home upon the rich soil; after which
he took his axe and started to hew down a tree
that interfered with the raising of the cabin.</p>

<p>Every soul in camp had plenty to do that
wonderful day. The men worked early and
late, assisting each other with the heavier labor
of lifting the logs, after they had been properly
hewn to fit. Even Pat swung a spare blade with
more or less skill, for he intended to stay about
until he had seen his good friends snugly installed
in their new home.</p>

<p>The wounded Indian seemed to be getting
along splendidly. His was a tough constitution,
and able to withstand a shock that would have
easily been fatal to one less accustomed to privations
and hardships.</p>

<p>He passed a few words with Bob now, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
his accomplishments in the line of English
seemed limited. Indeed, it was a mystery
where he had ever picked up what he did know;
though later on Bob discovered that there had
been a white woman taken prisoner by his tribe
a year or two previous, and that before she died
from some fever she had taken especial interest
in young Blue Jacket, for some reason or other,
teaching him many things.</p>

<p>When again night closed around the new settlement
there were a dozen cabins in process of
being erected. If the good work kept up, more
than one might have a roof completed by another
sunset.</p>

<p>A feeling of contentment reigned. Every one
seemed delighted with the location, and expressed
a feeling of gratitude toward Colonel
Boone, in that he had guided them to this place,
rather than allowed them to settle elsewhere
further up the river.</p>

<p>And, when another day was spent, the Armstrong
cabin was among the three that had the
roof completed, so that they could actually
move their belongings inside, and feel as though
their period of pilgrimage were at an end, since
once more they had a place to call home.</p>

<p>Trust that wife and mother to quickly add<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
the delicate little touches that would give it the
familiar air to which all of them were accustomed.
It was commodious enough to allow of
the wounded Indian's being carried within,
which task was performed by the two boys, assisted
by David himself; and the little mother
superintended the job of making him comfortable.</p>

<p>He was improving rapidly, and Bob knew
that it would not be many days before his patient
would be able to walk, for the wound had
started to heal in a magical way.</p>

<p>Though Blue Jacket said little, he watched
all the while. Not a thing went on but that
those beady black eyes saw it.</p>

<p>"I wonder what he thinks of it all," Mrs.
Armstrong said several times, as she noticed
how he followed her around with his gaze, while
she was engaged in some of her household duties.</p>

<p>"I only hope he appreciates what you are
doing for him enough not to bring any of his
friends down on us some fine night," said
David, who was only half reconciled to this
state of affairs, and had little use for the copper-colored
sons of the wilderness.</p>

<p>As the days passed on, and there was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
alarm of any kind, the new settlers found reason
to hope that the Indians, having been taught
a severe lesson in that battle of the night, meant
to leave them alone.</p>

<p>"Niver belave thot," said the wise O'Mara,
when he heard this opinion expressed, "they
do be the most treacherous av varmints. 'Tis
the lot av thim wud lull yees to slape, an' then
take yees be surprise. Watch always, me
friends! Kape wun eye open whin yees slape!
An' niver, niver go away from home widout a
gun an' plenty av powder an' ball. Faith, I
wudn't giv sixpence for the life av the man as
niglected the proper precautions whin dalin'
wid ridskins."</p>

<p>More than a whole week had now gone since
the little company of daring souls came to a
halt in this chosen spot; and then, one morning,
there fell in the midst of the Armstrong family
an unexpected shock that took every one by
surprise.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />

<small>THE SUDDEN PERIL</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Oh!</span> he's gone!"</p>

<p>Bob uttered these words one morning just
after daybreak. Being the first to awaken, he
had thought to start the fire so that his mother
might prepare an early breakfast, since all of
them were so full of business.</p>

<p>For he and Sandy had planned to go into the
woods that day, hoping to secure a deer, since
the stock of provisions was growing low.</p>

<p>"What ails you, Bob?" grunted Sandy, as
he sat up on his blanket and dug his knuckles
into a pair of heavy eyes.</p>

<p>"Blue Jacket&mdash;he's disappeared!" exclaimed
the other, still looking as though he
could not just grasp the fact that was so apparent.</p>

<p>Whereupon Sandy sprang up and stared at
the corner where the wounded Indian had been
accustomed to lying. The blanket was there,
but no Blue Jacket!</p>

<p>"What can have happened to him, Bob?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
exclaimed the younger boy, staring at his
brother. "You don't think that ugly Anthony
Brady did it? Oh! he surely could not have
dragged him away to do him harm?"</p>

<p>"Well, hardly," said the wiser Bob, with a
negative shake of the head; "because you see,
Sandy, I was sleeping not five feet away from
him all night, and you know I am not a hard
sleeper. They couldn't have dragged him away
and I not know it."</p>

<p>"But what do you think happened?" queried
the puzzled Sandy.</p>

<p>"Blue Jacket crept away while we slept. He
believed he was well enough to make the journey
to his village home," Bob went on saying,
just as though he understood it all perfectly
now.</p>

<p>"And without saying good-bye to any of us?
Did you ever hear of such ingratitude?" exclaimed
the other, throwing up both hands in
disgust.</p>

<p>"Wait. You do not know. Pat is still in
the settlement, and we can ask him what he
thinks about it. Anyhow, Indians are queer
fish. They never do things the same way we
do;" and Bob smiled at the angry look on his
brother's face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>"But if he wanted to go home why didn't
he tell us, and say good-bye in the right sort
of way, instead of sneaking off like a sly
mink!" Sandy kept on saying.</p>

<p>"Listen, and I'll tell you what I think. You
know what Mr. Brady said about his meaning
to shoot an Indian every time he saw one in the
woods! Blue Jacket heard that, and he must
have understood what it meant."</p>

<p>"Of course he did, for I saw him watching
Mr. Brady," Sandy admitted.</p>

<p>"Well," said Bob, "you see, he believed
that man was on the watch for the time he
would leave us. Now you and I understand
Brady has changed his mind a little about all
Indians being bad. But Blue Jacket didn't
know that. No doubt he suspected that, if he
went away in the daytime, some one would slip
after him and lay him low. And so he determined
to go while we were asleep. What do
you think of my guess now, Sandy!"</p>

<p>"It sounds all right," declared Sandy, enthusiastically;
"yes, I'd wager a shilling that
you have struck the truth, Bob. It takes you
to see through things. But here is father; let
us put it up to him."</p>

<p>Mr. Armstrong, upon hearing what had happened,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
immediately declared that the young
Shawanee must have considered it the part of
wisdom to slip away unnoticed while the settlement
was wrapped in peaceful slumber.</p>

<p>"Go out and ask the sentinels whether any
of them saw him," he said to the two boys;
"but I wager you will find that nobody knows
the first thing about him."</p>

<p>This proved to be the case, for, although the
young pioneers made the rounds of the men
who had been on guard duty during the entire
night, in no quarter could they learn that a
single flitting figure had really been seen.</p>

<p>One man had believed he saw something, but
reached the conclusion, after an investigation,
that it had only been a prowling raccoon or an
opossum, both of which animals were to be
found in plenty near the new settlement.</p>

<p>On the way back they ran across the genial
Irish trapper. He was oiling some of his traps,
as though ready to put them away until another
season.</p>

<p>"The ridskin gone, is it, me byes?" he observed,
after Sandy had told him why they were
going around asking questions. "Well, upon
me honor I'm not wan bit surprised, knowin'
the sly ways av the animal so well. But, by yer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
lave, I'll go wid yees till the home, an' say if
the ungrateful skunk had the good manners to
lave a sign to till what he thought."</p>

<p>So it was Pat's eyes that discovered something
fastened to a crevice between two of the
logs, as yet unfilled by mud. It seemed to be
a bit of inner bark which Blue Jacket must have
obtained possession of recently, after he was
able to limp around the interior of the new
cabin, and even venture outside a little way.</p>

<p>Upon this he had scratched various rude
signs. To the ignorant boys they looked like
the crude work of a little child attempting to
draw a pig, and some other domestic animals;
but with Pat O'Mara it was different. Every
little mark had a meaning of its own in his
experienced eyes, for he had seen much of this
Indian picture writing.</p>

<p>"Sure, 'tis just what I thought, byes," he
declared, as he scanned this piece of bark with
its cipher message. "He knowed wan av us
min would be able to rade this missage."</p>

<p>"But what does it say, Pat?" demanded the
impatient Sandy.</p>

<p>"In so many worrds thin," began the other,
wrinkling his brows, "that he will niver, niver
forgit what yees have done for him; and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
some day perhaps he may have a chanct to repay
ye for it all. Begorra, afther all the rid
sarpint did have some falin' in him! I takes
back all I iver sed aginst the lad. Who knows
but thot this may be the interin' wedge whereby
we may make a treaty av pace wid the bloody
Injuns?"</p>

<p>Both boys were sorry that Blue Jacket was
gone. Bob in particular had begun to feel quite
drawn to the young Indian. Of late they had
spent considerable time trying to converse. The
Shawanee had told him more or less about his
tribe, and in turn had learned that the motives
of the invading whites were not at all warlike,
if they were only let alone.</p>

<p>The axes sounded through the livelong day,
as the settlers continued to clear away the
woods which shut them in so closely. The further
the fringe of nearest trees could be moved
back, the freer would they breathe; for it
seemed as though enemies must ever be lurking
in the gloomy depths of the dense forest.</p>

<p>Fish were taken from the river with the utmost
ease, and furnished many a fine meal,
though many of them were of a species utterly
unknown to any of the settlers. Blue Jacket<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
had said they were good to eat, however, and
so they had been found on testing them.</p>

<p>The cabins continued to arise, as it were, in
a night. In this duty the new settlers always
assisted one another when the time came for
the log raising, since what was the interest of
one must ever be the interest of all.</p>

<p>As fast as the trees were cut down, the virgin
soil was turned over, rich as it was in valuable
leaf mold, and some of the seeds, so carefully
hoarded during the long journey from their
Virginia starting place, were planted.</p>

<p>It was wonderful what rapid changes took
place in that favored spot. Every sunset saw
new cabins being topped with such rude shingles
as the newcomers could hew from the timber
which was so plentiful. No sooner was a
cabin finished than the fortunate family would
move in. Little they cared that there was not
a piece of furniture awaiting them; and that
tables and seats would all have to be made. A
sound roof over their heads in case of storm
was the main thing; besides, no doubt the
women naturally felt safer behind stout walls,
rather than settled in tents, or make-shift shelters
of branches. They could not easily forget
the terrors of that awful night when the Indians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
had attacked the camp, and looked eagerly
forward to the day when the entire settlement
might have a strong blockhouse where
all could find safety in case of sudden need.</p>

<p>Then, by degrees, came the work of making
things more comfortable for the women.
Nearly every man could use fairly well the
primitive tools of the day; and where this skill
were lacking he might exchange his abilities in
some other line with a more accomplished
neighbor, so that the necessary deal table, and
the benches, as well as bunks, or rude beds, for
sleeping, were secured.</p>

<p>Certain of the members of the little community
were given other tasks. Food had to
be secured, and fortunately there was no lack,
with the adjacent river to supply plenty of
fresh fish for the taking, and the bountiful store
of game awaiting the coming of the marksman.</p>

<p>Thus, in a very brief space of time, things
began to take on a homelike appearance. Outdoor
cooking might still be indulged in to a
great extent; but there would also be times
when the tempting venison roast would again
be made ready for the table by the turning of
the familiar spit over a fire of red ashes on the
big hearth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>These hardy pioneers seldom had need of
medicine, such was their active life, and plain
wholesome fare; nevertheless, every family always
kept a store of certain dried herbs used
for fevers and other ailments. As a rule accidents
alone required medical care; but there
was always some woman in a settlement more
highly favored than her companions in knowledge
of nursing; and to her they looked in
times of need.</p>

<p>Many of their cooking utensils they made
themselves out of clay, which was baked after
a rude fashion, just as the Indians did. These
vessels, while not very fine looking, answered
most admirably the purposes to which they
were put, and many of them have been handed
down to the descendants of these early Ohio
settlers, to be treasured with due reverence.</p>

<p>Salt they could obtain readily enough. In
Kentucky and Ohio in these days there were
what were called "salt licks," because deer
and buffalo frequented the places in order to
gratify their longing for this almost indispensable
commodity. Here they were able to
secure with little effort whatever quantity of
salt was needed.</p>

<p>Bob and Sandy were always on the lookout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
for such "licks." They knew from Daniel
Boone and O'Mara that, whenever they wanted
deer, it was simplest to hide close to one of
these salt licks, and wait until buck or doe came
to gratify its craving; when they could usually
secure their game by a single shot.</p>

<p>It might seem rather hard that the poor deer
should be taken advantage of in this way; but
these men of the border looked upon the stocking
of the limitless forest with various kinds
of game as a wise provision of Nature, intended
primarily for their good while peopling the
land, and extending civilization westward
toward that wonderful river of which they
never tired of talking, the Mississippi.</p>

<p>David Armstrong had considered the situation
carefully before starting from Virginia on
this long journey. He also talked it over with
Pat O'Mara. Consequently he had utilized
every bit of money he could lay hands on to
purchase certain articles which the Irish trapper
assured him could be traded to the friendly
Indians for their precious pelts of mink, fox,
beaver, bear and other kinds of wild animals.</p>

<p>The French traders had, up to now, monopolized
this business along the frontier all the
way from the great inland seas, of which so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
little was known, down to the great province
of Louisiana on the Gulf. They understood
that their day would soon be brought to an end
once the English invaded this vast territory;
and consequently they were forever endeavoring
to arouse the savages against Daniel Boone
and those other hardy spirits who meant to
chop out trails through the new country, and
found a race of English-speaking settlers.</p>

<p>Mr. Armstrong intended to become a trader.
In this way he believed he might earn enough
to support his little family; especially since he
had two such industrious boys, who could do
so much to help out by bringing in game in
season, tilling the little garden around the new
home, and making good use of the few rusty
and cumbersome traps they had brought all the
way from Virginia.</p>

<p>In their hunts the boys had already learned
that there was an apparently endless supply
of small fur-bearing animals among the valleys
within ten miles of their new home.</p>

<p>"Just think what great times we can have
next winter," said Sandy, as they prepared for
another jaunt into the timber, and this subject
was brought up by the sight of Pat's rusty
traps hanging from a peg on the side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
inner wall; for Pat was now ready to take one
of his periodical lonely trips deeper into the
unknown region further down the great river.</p>

<p>Just then the Irish trapper himself came out
from the inner room, where he had been saying
good-bye to their mother.</p>

<p>"Sure it's off I am, me byes," he observed,
as he held out a hand to each, while his humorous
blue eyes twinkled as he strove to keep back
the tear which tried desperately to break loose.
"Take good care av yersilves, now. And whist,
lads; until the spring rains do be comin' to
wit down the dead laves in the forest, it wud
pay yees to be careful how ye set a fire goin'.
Wanst caught in a forest fire was enough for
me, thank ye."</p>

<p>"Why, of course we will, Pat," said Bob,
shaking the honest hand of the trapper warmly;
"and we all hope you will be back this way
before long."</p>

<p>"And if you run across Colonel Boone," remarked
Sandy, "as I reckon you mean to, tell
him how glad we are to be here."</p>

<p>To all of which Pat promised faithfully;
after which he shouldered his long barrelled
rifle, gave a hitch to his leather trousers, waved
his hand to Kate, who was looking out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
window, her pretty face bedewed with tears,
and then, whistling merrily to hide his own emotion,
he strode away.</p>

<p>A minute later he waved to them from the
border of the dense woods; then he was gone,
and no one could say whether they would ever
again look upon the genial face of the happy
Irish trapper. For his life was one constant
succession of perilous adventures amidst wild
beasts and even wilder human beings, so that
he actually held his existence in the hollow of
his hand.</p>

<p>"Come on, let us make a start," said Sandy,
as impatient as ever.</p>

<p>Presently the two lads found themselves
tramping along through the woods, on the alert
for any game worth wasting precious powder
and lead upon.</p>

<p>It had been quite mild of late, but to-day the
wind had veered back into the old quarter
where the ice king dwelt, and was growing
stronger all the time. To the young hunters,
however, the air was only invigorating, and
gave tone to their efforts.</p>

<p>"Queer that we have seen nothing worth
shooting up to now," remarked Sandy, after
they had been tramping a full hour. "What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
do you think is the matter, Bob? Can the Indians
be about, and have they frightened all the
deer and buffalo away?"</p>

<p>Bob shook his head.</p>

<p>"I was just wondering," he said, "if we
made too much noise stalking through all these
dead leaves. Did you ever see such a thick
mass? And as dry as tinder, too. See, when
the wind catches them up, how they whirl like
mad."</p>

<p>"Goodness!" remarked Sandy, remembering
the caution of the trapper; "wouldn't it
just be awful if they caught fire? We must be
miles away from home, and could never reach
it. What in the world would we do, Bob?"</p>

<p>Then, as he glanced up at his brother when
asking this question, he discovered that Bob
was standing there, sniffing the air suspiciously!
In the present excited condition of Sandy's
nerves that, of course, was enough to set him
wild.</p>

<p>"What is it? You smell something&mdash;oh!
Bob, please don't tell me that it is smoke!"
he exclaimed, his voice trembling with sudden
alarm.</p>

<p>"That is just what I do smell," replied Bob,
uneasily, though, seeing the distress of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
brother, he immediately tried to laugh it off.
"But perhaps it comes from some campfire
started by the Indians. How do we know but
what we may be close to a village, since no one
has ever come this way before?"</p>

<p>"Now I get it," cried Sandy, "and, Bob,
listen, what can that roaring sound mean? Are
we near the river, and is that a rapids of any
sort?"</p>

<p>In spite of his bravery, and his desire not to
frighten Sandy, Bob felt that his face turned
pale, for he knew instinctively what that strange
sound meant.</p>

<p>"Come, perhaps we had better turn around,
and walk this way," he said, suiting his action
to the words.</p>

<p>"You know something, and you're trying to
keep it from me, brother. That isn't fair. Tell
me the worst, Bob! That rushing sound up on
the wind&mdash;<i>does that mean the woods are on
fire?</i>"</p>

<p>"That is just what it means, Sandy," said
the other, "and we must run like mad now!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />

<small>CHASED BY THE FLAMES</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">But</span> this way is not the way home, Bob!"
expostulated the younger lad, even as he clung
close to the flying feet of his brother.</p>

<p>"True," Bob flung over his shoulder, while
he ran on; "but it is away from the fire, and
that must be enough for us now. Can you go
any faster, Sandy?"</p>

<p>"I know what it is!" cried the other, his
voice trembling under the great strain; "you
mean that the noise is getting louder all the
while! Then the fire must be gaining on us!
We will be caught!"</p>

<p>"Oh! I do not say that," and Bob fell back a
trifle so as to run alongside his companion;
"but it is certainly advancing very fast and furiously.
This wild wind whips it along much
quicker than any man can run."</p>

<p>"Look!" cried Sandy, suddenly, "what is
that over yonder? Surely it is a buffalo&mdash;two,
three of them! And see how they gallop along,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
with their heads lowered, and the hot steam
pouring from their nostrils!"</p>

<p>"They smell the smoke and hear the noise,"
Bob replied, speaking in jerks as he ran.
"Perhaps they may never have seen a fire before,
but they know what it means. And there
goes a stag! Look at the tremendous leaps he
is taking! No danger of his being caught by the
flames!"</p>

<p>"Don't I wish we could run as fast! What
a pair of horns for this time of year!" said
Sandy, who knew that it was the season when
stags lose their antlers, to be replaced with a
new pair.</p>

<p>"Too bad we could not get one of those buffalo,"
observed Bob; "but it would be wicked
to kill the poor beast when we could never save
the meat. Let them live to another day."</p>

<p>"Yes, we have all we want to do now, trying
to save ourselves," panted Sandy, who was not
his brother's equal in running, and was already
beginning to show evident signs of exhaustion.</p>

<p>Bob noticed this with increasing uneasiness.</p>

<p>"We can never get away by running," he declared,
as he shortened his pace; and Sandy
hastened to do likewise, with evident relief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>"Would it do to climb high up in a tree?"
the latter hazarded at a venture.</p>

<p>"Not at all, for we should be smothered with
the smoke, even if we managed to keep from being
cured like bacon. But I was thinking that if
only we could run across a hollow tree we might
find refuge in it," said Bob, looking eagerly to
the right and left.</p>

<p>Already the smoke, driven ahead of the
flames, was beginning to make objects indistinct
around them. It burned their eyes, and
caused a shortness of breath that was a sample
of what it might be when the full force of the
forest fire swept down upon them.</p>

<p>"But suppose the tree caught fire, and
burned," said Sandy, in bewilderment; "how
could we save ourselves then?"</p>

<p>"You don't understand, Sandy," returned
the other, quickly. "The trees will hardly
burn at this season of the year, being full of
sap. This fire is made up of all the dead leaves
and ground stuff. It is fierce while it lasts; but
it burns out in a short time. All we need is
some shelter that can hold out against that wall
of flame coming down on us."</p>

<p>Something in his brother's words caused
Sandy to glance back just then. What the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
alarmed lad saw was a terrifying spectacle indeed.
The fire was in sight, and coming on at
headlong speed. The vast amount of dry material
waiting to be snatched up by the leaping
tongues of flame caused the fire to mount upward
fully twenty feet in the air.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 310px;">
<img src="images/i189.jpg" width="310" height="500" alt="man fleeing forest fire" />
<div class="caption">"THE FIRE WAS .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. COMING ON AT HEADLONG SPEED."</div>
</div>

<p>"It lies in both directions as far as I
can see!" gasped Sandy, surprised at the
extent of the conflagration that menaced
them.</p>

<p>"Yes. I knew it, and that was why we could
not get beyond the end of the line. That wind
is something terrible. Look out for that herd
of deer, brother; they are heading straight for
us, crazed with fear!"</p>

<p>Just in time did Bob whirl in his tracks and
fire his gun, almost in the faces of the onrushing
group of maddened animals, and this action
caused them to veer, so that they passed by
without doing injury.</p>

<p>"Oh! what a narrow escape!" cried Sandy,
who had been almost paralyzed by the nature
of the sudden peril confronting them.</p>

<p>And now they saw all manner of frightened
animals speeding away as fast as their legs
could carry them. Besides, a flock of wild turkeys
sprang up with a furious whirring of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
wings, and were gone like magic. Partridges
sailed past the two boys in coveys. Here a pair
of red foxes fairly flashed by, making incredible
speed.</p>

<p>Everything seemed capable of getting out of
the way of those greedy flames save the two
young pioneers. It appeared at times to poor,
impatient Sandy that they were having one of
those ugly nightmares, where one's feet are
glued to the ground, and all the while the
peril plunges along toward the wretched
dreamer.</p>

<p>"If we could only find a cave of any kind, it
might keep us from getting scorched!" ventured
Sandy presently, though he found he
had to raise his voice considerably in order
to be heard, so loud were those terrible
noises that accompanied the rush of the fire
wall.</p>

<p>"But there are none around here, for I have
been looking," answered Bob.</p>

<p>"I saw lots a while ago, all sorts of queer
holes in the ground and rocks. Oh! don't I
wish we could find just one now!" cried the
other.</p>

<p>"Ha! here is what we are looking for, a
hollow tree trunk!" Bob shouted, just at that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
moment, when hope had well nigh deserted poor
Sandy.</p>

<p>He dragged his brother over to the left, to
where a rather large oak stood.</p>

<p>"I just happened to look back, and saw the
opening. The tree is hollow, brother! Push in,
and try to close the opening all you can, so as to
keep out the smoke!"</p>

<p>Almost before he knew what Bob was about,
Sandy found himself shoved through the rather
narrow opening.</p>

<p>"But it is not big enough for two! We can
never stay here, Bob. Help me out!" for all at
once the lad realized what his brother meant
to do.</p>

<p>Did he not know only too well the self-sacrificing
devotion of Bob? The other meant that
he should find possible safety in this snug retreat,
while he took chances of discovering another
hole in which to burrow. And if the fire
rushed down upon him before this discovery
could be made, what then? There would be
only one of them go back to the new cabin in
the clearing that looked out on the clear waters
of the Ohio.</p>

<p>"Stay where you are, and do not move, on
your life, or you will ruin all! There is another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
hollow tree for me! Remember mother, and do
what I say!" And, giving Sandy a last push,
Bob darted away.</p>

<p>Eagerly the boy, encased in the hollow tree,
tried to follow his brother with his smarting
eyes; but the smoke was growing very dense
as well as pungent now, and he could hardly
see at all for the tears that blinded him. So,
not daring to disobey that last injunction on the
part of Bob, whom he was accustomed to minding,
he could only press his back into the cleft,
to shut out the choking smoke, and count the
seconds as they passed.</p>

<p>The fire was quickly all around him, and he
could feel the fierce heat of the burning leaves.
Fear for his own safety was almost entirely
lost sight of in his anxiety concerning Bob.
What if he had not been able to find a hiding-place
after all, and was exposed to the full fury
of that scorching blast!</p>

<p>The very thought made Sandy feel weak. He
groaned in anguish, and, from the very depths
of his boyish heart, a prayer went up for the
safety of the brother whom he loved so well.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, what of Bob, who took his life in
his hand, content to feel assured that at the
worst Sandy would be saved?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>When Bob declared so vehemently that there
was another hollow tree for him near by he
said that of which he was by no means certain.
He did this in order that Sandy might not push
out from his refuge, and insist on sharing his
fate.</p>

<p>Of course he still had hopes that he might yet
find some friendly shelter from the flames;
and, as he rushed along, his eyes sought every
tree he passed, hoping thus to discover an opening,
into which he might crowd himself, and
bid the flames defiance.</p>

<p>But the precious seconds were passing, and,
as yet, he had found no shelter.</p>

<p>Twice had he caught sight of what seemed a
chance; but upon rushing up to the tree, his
heart beating high with anticipation, it was
only to discover that the split was not nearly
large enough to allow of the passage of his
body, and seconds were too valuable just then
to dream of trying to slash at the wood with his
sharp hunting knife in the hope of enlarging
the opening.</p>

<p>Long before he could do this the threatening
billow of fire must have reached the spot, and
passed over him, so, in despair, he rushed
along, his eyes now even scanning the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
ground for some log behind which he might
crawl.</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Bob suddenly, as his glance
caught a dark opening in a half-dead tree
trunk.</p>

<p>It was some little distance from the ground,
possibly ten feet or more, but as a few limbs
remained on the decayed forest monarch, once
blasted by a wind-storm while in its prime, he
believed he might readily reach the friendly
crevice ere the flames took hold upon his buckskin
garments.</p>

<p>Bob was almost exhausted from his violent
exertions; but he certainly gave no evidence of
the fact, to judge from the way in which he ran
to that tree and commenced to clamber into the
lower branches.</p>

<p>Burning leaves were already being swept
past him on the breath of the wind, to drop into
new magazines of dry tinder, and start additional
fires ahead of the main blaze.</p>

<p>Madly did he climb upward, and never would
he forget the sight that met his eyes while making
for that promised haven of refuge. As far
as he could see, both to the east and to the west,
that bank of leaping roaring flame held sway.
Once Bob had been taken down to the sea by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
his father, and he had never forgotten how the
great waves came sweeping resistlessly on, to
break with a crash on the shore. So, in his
mind, appeared those onrolling billows of fire.</p>

<p>He could hardly breathe now. That was because
of the heat and smoke combined. A great
fear possessed him that perhaps after he had
reached this dark cleft in the tree he might find
it utterly impossible to push his way past the
guarding portals. In that case all was lost, and
he need not even mind dropping back to the
ground, for the end would find him where he
was.</p>

<p>But at least that fear was quickly laid to rest.</p>

<p>"It's plenty big enough!" he cried aloud in
his new delight, for the opening was now only
a couple of feet away from his hands.</p>

<p>After that all he had to do was to cram his
body through the hole, and find the shelter he
craved.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!"</p>

<p>Somehow he could not help giving vent to
that boyish shout at the prospect of cheating
the fire out of its anticipated prey, although
he really had little breath to spare just then.
He even fixed it in his mind just how he must
first of all thrust his lower limbs through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
opening, and then allow himself to slide downwards,
for he could already see that the hole
extended toward the earth.</p>

<p>It was not the first time Bob Armstrong
found his nice little calculations upset by circumstances
utterly beyond his control. Perhaps
it would not be the last, either, since he
expected to spend the major portion of his life
roving the wilderness, in search of game, and
in such labor as became a true pioneer.</p>

<p>Just as Bob reached the hole in the tree he
became conscious of the fact that the old stump
was being violently agitated, as though some
one were climbing up below him. He even
glanced down, filled with a dread lest Sandy
had after all disobeyed, and chased after him.</p>

<p>Then something else attracted his attention
and he raised his eyes, to make a most unpleasant
discovery.</p>

<p>The hole in the tree was no longer vacant, but
a bristling black head and a pair of very frightened
eyes met his startled gaze!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />

<small>A STRANGE PRISON</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> bear looked at Bob; and Bob stared at
the bear.</p>

<p>It was a mutual surprise, though on the
whole, perhaps, the animal was the more astonished,
since up to this time he could not have
had any inkling of the tremendous things that
were occurring so near his home.</p>

<p>He blinked his little eyes as the glare of the
great conflagration dazzled his vision; but at
the same time there was not the faintest indication
that Mr. Bruin thought of dropping back
into his snug retreat.</p>

<p>Here was a pretty kettle of fish, with the bear
wanting to come out, and Bob just as set upon
going in. Evidently there was a conflict of
opinions as to the proper thing to do when the
forest took to blazing. Bruin believed flight
might serve him best; while the young pioneer
knew positively that in his case it would not
answer at all.</p>

<p>Of course, when he first caught sight of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
black muzzle, the boy had given a low cry of
alarm. Possibly Mr. Bear had never up to now
heard a human voice save, it might be, the war
whoop of the red man. It did not seem, however,
to deter him in the least from trying to
carry out his original plan.</p>

<p>He began to move upward, and Bob could
hear his sharp claws digging into the interior
of the stump, assisting his progress.</p>

<p>The situation needed prompt measures for
relief. To drop down again to the ground was
not to be considered for a moment, since there
was the advancing fire to consider.</p>

<p>Fortunately Bob was a quick thinker, and
often did things on the spur of the moment, as
though acting from intuition rather than after
deliberation and planning.</p>

<p>Let the bear come out, if that was his intention!
Not for the whole world would he offer
the slightest objection to such a process, for he
wanted that snug den in the stump, and he
wanted it more, apparently, than the beast did.</p>

<p>At the same time a collision was not at all
to his liking. He had his gun strapped to his
back, and was therefore in no condition to defend
himself.</p>

<p>The only way to avoid a meeting was to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
the beast plenty of room. Undoubtedly the bear
was growing frantic with fear at sight of the
fire. Some inward sense told Bruin that the
gravest danger of his whole life now faced him,
and, unable to understand that the safest course
would have been to drop back inside his fortress
and let the hurricane of fire sweep past, he was
bent on fleeing before the gale.</p>

<p>Of course it would prove a fatal error of
judgment for the animal, but what was Bruin's
loss might be Bob's gain.</p>

<p>Already his head and shoulders had issued
from the hole, and he was surging forward,
intent on one thing, which was to quit his quarters
as speedily as his huge bulk would permit
it.</p>

<p>Bob swung himself half way around the trunk
of the tree. He found it rather difficult to hang
on, but, being tenacious by nature, and a good
climber, he clung desperately to what stubs of
branches he found there.</p>

<p>Would the beast follow after him, bent on
making an attack on the bold two-legged enemy
that had ventured to brazenly face him at the
mouth of his private castle?</p>

<p>Bob had little fear of this. He believed the
bear was too much alarmed by the unusual spectacle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
of the woods afire, and was seized with
the same sort of panic that had sent buffalo,
stags, wolves, foxes and even a gray panther
bounding along to leeward as fast as their muscles
could drive them.</p>

<p>He knew when Bruin had managed to drag
his entire bulk out from the enclosure, for the
scene was by this time as well lighted up as
though the sun shone through the eddying
smoke clouds, only it was a red, angry glare,
peculiarly terrifying.</p>

<p>Yes, thank goodness, the beast was scurrying
down the trunk of the old tree as fast as he
possibly could. Fright urged him on, and Bob
could not help adding to the situation by giving
a shrill whoop.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir; with your leave I will tumble
into your late berth," he exclaimed, as he
struggled to pass around the stump again, in
order to reach the opening.</p>

<p>Short as was the time consumed in doing this,
when he reached the gap in the trunk the bear
had already tumbled to the ground. Bob heard
the beast give utterance to a subdued roar, as
though some of the flying leaves that were afire
might have alighted on his hairy hide; then
the black beast galloped madly off, heading in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
a direct line away from the approaching
fire.</p>

<p>But well did Bob know that, unless Bruin had
some near-by cave in mind when he thus scampered
off, the chances were ten to one he would
roast in the conflagration, since he could never
hope to outstrip its onward rush.</p>

<p>Bob did not stop to see anything more just
then. The air was already scorching, the smoke
blinding, and there was danger lest his garments
take fire unless he speedily dropped out
of reach of the flying leaves.</p>

<p>Of course there was only one way in which to
properly enter that hole in the old tree trunk.
That was feet first, just as the original proprietor
of the den had been in the habit of
doing.</p>

<p>Regardless of almost everything else save the
fact that he was in a tremendous hurry, the boy
pushed his figure through the aperture. Since
there was nothing to which he could apply his
moccasined toes, in order to stay his downward
movement, the consequence of haste was that
Bob took a quick passage to the very bottom of
the tree trunk.</p>

<p>Beyond a few minor scratches, however, he
did not think that he had received any hurt, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
such trifles were not to be considered, when he
had such a serious problem at stake as saving
his life.</p>

<p>Looking upward he could see the opening, for
through it glowed the light of the conflagration.
From this he was able to judge that the aperture
must be some five feet above his head.</p>

<p>There was ample room in the stump's interior
for the boy to move around, and, on the whole,
he did not doubt but that it had formed quite
a pleasant den in which a bear could hibernate
through the long winter.</p>

<p>Already could he hear the roar of the flames
all around him. Really, the sound was rather
terrifying, though he knew full well it would
be quickly over.</p>

<p>At least there was now no fear of the bear
returning. That possibility had worried Bob
for a brief period, since it would be very inconvenient
to have had the singed animal dropping
down upon him in that confined space.</p>

<p>"Phew! but it's getting warm in here!" he
could not help exclaiming, as the perspiration
began to ooze from his pores, and he found himself
actually panting for breath.</p>

<p>He judged that by now he was in the worst
of the fire. This meant that it would have swept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
past the tree in another couple of minutes, and
after that the heat must gradually decrease.</p>

<p>Yes, already he felt sure that the loud roaring
was growing sensibly less. The wave of fire
had passed on, snatching up new supplies of
dry fuel as it rushed along its way on the teeth
of the wind.</p>

<p>More than once his thoughts had gone out to
Sandy.</p>

<p>"Oh! I hope he stayed where I put him, and
that all is well," he kept repeating to himself,
as he sweltered in his hot oven.</p>

<p>Surely it ought to be getting much more comfortable
by now; and yet Bob could not positively
say that he felt any cooling influence.</p>

<p>Perhaps he would be wise to climb upward
toward the exit, ready to thrust his head out,
and see how the land lay. No sooner had this
idea flashed upon him than he started to carry
it out, only to make a very unpleasant discovery.</p>

<p>He groped around him, seeking to find some
projection that would give a grip or a foothold,
but only to meet with grievous disappointment.</p>

<p>"Why, what shall I do?" he cried aloud, in
his sudden chagrin. "The inside of this old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
tree is as smooth as an otter slide! And I have
no claws, like the bear, to help me climb up!"</p>

<p>He tried pushing his back against one side
of the hollow, while with his knees and hands
he pressed against the opposite wall. It was
a favorite trick which Bob had carried out successfully
on more than one occasion. Somehow
it did not seem to work now.</p>

<p>Whether in his excitement he failed to take
advantage of every little gain, or because the
bear in his frequent passage up and down had
polished the chute so that it was impossible for
the boy to hold on, was a question Bob never
found himself fully qualified to answer.</p>

<p>All he knew was that three times he managed
to get up a little distance, only to suddenly slide
down again and land in a heap at the bottom.</p>

<p>His failures were discouraging, to say the
least. The worst of it all was that there did
not seem to be any hope that, even given time,
he could manage to accomplish the task, unless
he took out his knife and deliberately hacked
notches in the sides of his prison upon which
he could rest his toes.</p>

<p>That would take hours of time; and meanwhile
what of Sandy?</p>

<p>"I'll give it another try," he muttered, loth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
to confess himself beaten, "and then, if I fail
to make it, something else must be done, for
out of this I'm going to get, by hook or by
crook!"</p>

<p>This time he took particular pains in his
movements. Inch by inch he kept advancing by
that shuffling movement that always pushed his
figure away from the ground.</p>

<p>Hope even began to find a lodgment in his
breast, for the bottom of the aperture seemed
now within a foot of his reach, and, once let
him get a grip on that, he could count the battle
won.</p>

<p>Then again there came a miscalculation, a
trifling slip that upset his gravity, and once
more poor Bob went plunging down to the bottom,
worse off than ever.</p>

<p>He actually grunted and groaned as he sat
there, feeling to see if he had received any more
damage than a few bruises from this heavy fall.</p>

<p>And, strange to say, his back seemed to
trouble him more than any other part of his
body.</p>

<p>"Feels as if I had started to roast along my
spine," he said, as he found his buckskin tunic
exceedingly hot when he laid a hand on it.</p>

<p>Then, all at once, the truth burst upon him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>"The old stump is afire! That's what that
flashing means I saw through the opening!
Why, I may be roasted here after all! What
can I do?" he asked himself, once more struggling
to his feet, and forgetting all his minor
injuries as he contemplated this serious condition.</p>

<p>To find out if his suspicion were true he
started placing his hand at various spots along
the inside of the tree trunk, and, from the intense
heat, he found little hope that he had
made a mistake.</p>

<p>Was it worth while trying again to mount
upward? Could he dig his toes into the smooth
walls with enough vigor to sustain his weight?
Four failures rather dampened his ardor along
this line.</p>

<p>His groping hand came in contact with his
musket, which he had thrown aside on first finding
himself caged in this trap. It had been
leaning against the side of his prison all the
while. To fire it would be useless, for who was
there to come to his assistance?</p>

<p>Suppose he managed to climb up again as far
as on the last disastrous occasion, could he get
any support by placing the butt of the gun upward,
as a rest for one foot?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a last desperate resort, and poor Bob
shuddered at pressing his already tortured back
against that heated wooden funnel. If there
were only some other way by which he might
hope to gain the outer air, how gladly would he
welcome it!</p>

<p>Just then he noticed something&mdash;he had
really seen it before, but paid little attention to
the fact, being wholly taken up with the idea of
reaching the hole above.</p>

<p>And, while this new sight did not seem to hold
out any positive chances for an escape from his
burning prison, Bob believed that it might be
worth throwing all his last efforts into this new
channel.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<small>AFTER THE FOREST FIRE</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> old tree trunk was slowly giving way
to the demands of Nature. It had a split up
and down one side, where doubtless the wood
was rotting away. Bob could see out of it&mdash;see
the gray, smoky landscape, still lighted by
flashes of fire. During the progress of the fire
he had even watched the roaring whirlwind
sweep past; and then forgotten all about this
crevice in his mad desire to climb up to the hole
that served as the bear's exit.</p>

<p>The thought that came to him was this&mdash;that
perhaps with the aid of his sharp hunting knife,
and a set determination to bring about results,
he might manage to enlarge this narrow opening
enough to admit of his bursting forth!</p>

<p>He did not lose another second in wondering
whether it could be done. There was absolutely
nothing else for him to try, if he hoped to keep
from being slowly suffocated in that prison cell.
He could do it, he <i>must</i> do it!</p>

<p>When he set to work, he found at once that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
the wood was inclined to be soft and wormy,
especially close to the crack. Time had overcome
the hardness of the oak, and under his
vigorous assault it fairly crumbled away in sections.</p>

<p>After what may have been a minute's labor
but which seemed much longer, Bob was able
to thrust his whole arm through the cleft he had
made.</p>

<p>At that rate he would soon be free. The very
thought gave him new energy, and he went at
the task even more fiercely than before. But
somehow his rate of progress did not seem to
increase in proportion to the extra vim he threw
into the work.</p>

<p>Evidently the deeper he cut, the harder the
wood became. It was decayed only along the
crevice!</p>

<p>Realizing this, he now turned his attention to
the other side, and for a brief time all went
smoothly, progress being rapid. Now he could
even thrust a leg out of his cell. Twice that
dimension, and the gap would be large enough
to admit of the passage of his entire body.</p>

<p>But surely it was getting much hotter inside
the stump. The fire had taken hold in earnest.
He believed that the flames must be curling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
around the old tree, and mounting upward while
they fed upon the dead wood.</p>

<p>It mattered not just then that his hand grew
sore from constant friction with the rough
buck-horn handle of his knife. Such little
things could not count when everything depended
on his making a success of his effort.</p>

<p>Just then Bob needed all the encouragement
he could find. He realized this, and to try and
cheer up his drooping spirits he started talking
to himself while he worked, even laughing from
time to time.</p>

<p>It encouraged him, and could do no harm.</p>

<p>"That was a good slice, Bob!" he went on,
just as though it might be his mother speaking,
"Keep it up, my boy! You're just bound to
break out of this smoke-stack soon! Nothing can
stop you, now you've got started in the right
direction. Hey! almost dropped my knife outside
that time. Gracious! what if it had gone
beyond my reach! You must be more careful
after this, Robert, my lad!"</p>

<p>He sliced away, and the opening grew wider;
but, oh! how slowly its dimensions increased,
and how much hotter did the air seem all around
him!</p>

<p>Was it fated that he should be smothered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
here, suffocated by the pungent smoke that
caught his breath, and seemed to choke him?
He would not allow himself to give way to even
the thought of such a horrible thing.</p>

<p>"Sure you will get through, Bob!" he
shouted, as he kept working away with every
atom of strength. "Why, the hole must be
mighty near big enough now for you to slip
through. Sandy could do it, I know, and I'm
not much stouter than he. Just hold out a little
longer, boy! Keep at it, and success must
come."</p>

<p>His knife was no longer keen, since its working
edge had been worn away against the tough
wood; but, under the efforts Bob put into his
work, it still sliced off shavings with every
downward movement.</p>

<p>He thrust his head forward, more in the desire
to suck in some of the outer air than because
he expected to be able to pass it through
the opening.</p>

<p>A thrill shook his whole frame when he found
that he could thus thrust his head completely
out of the prison cell. Seized with a new hope
he began wriggling his body sideways, his right
shoulder first of all being pushed through.</p>

<p>And though it proved a tremendous task, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
a tight fit, Bob managed to press completely
through the narrow aperture! He fell in a heap
on the ground, almost done for, yet with a feeling
of thanksgiving. And his second thought
was of that mother who he knew full well
would be heartbroken should anything happen
to either Sandy or himself.</p>

<p>Although Bob had apparently collapsed after
bursting out from his strange prison, he did not
long remain there on the earth.</p>

<p>"I must be up and doing," he cried, as he
struggled to gain his feet.</p>

<p>There was Sandy to think of, and, besides, it
was quite too hot so close to the burning stump.
How he longed for a cool drink to moisten his
parched throat!</p>

<p>"My gun! I could not think of leaving that
behind!" he exclaimed, turning back once more,
after starting to leave the scene of his singular
adventure.</p>

<p>Throwing himself down on the ground, he
pushed close up to the tree and inserted his
arm, groping in the quarter where he remembered
his musket had last stood. At first he
failed to touch it.</p>

<p>"Why, that's odd," he exclaimed, dismayed
at the idea of losing his precious weapon, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
another could not probably have been obtained
in its place for long, weary months.</p>

<p>Perhaps, after all, it happened to be just
out of reach of his fingers. Thinking thus,
Bob snatched up a piece of wood that had escaped
the ground conflagration. It was about
a foot or so in length, and afforded him the
assistance he needed.</p>

<p>"There it is, if I can only start it coming
this way!" he observed, still imbibing renewed
courage from his habit of talking to himself.</p>

<p>It proved that he could readily manage to
move the heavy gun; and almost immediately
his eager fingers were clutching the butt of the
musket.</p>

<p>"Now, after all, I'm little the worse off for
it all," declared Bob, as he hastened to scramble
further away from the pillar of fire before
rising to his feet; "and the next thing is&mdash;Sandy!"</p>

<p>He seemed to feel a sudden sinking in the
region of his heart just at thought of his
brother, and yet, if the boy had followed his
instructions to the letter, surely no ill could
have overwhelmed him.</p>

<p>"That tree was sounder than the one where
the bear had his den," he kept muttering to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
himself as he hurried along over the blackened
ground in the direction where he believed he
must find the hollow oak given over to Sandy;
"and after it was all over he could come out
much easier than I did. But why have I not
heard his signal call? Would he not follow
after the fire, seeking some sign of me?"</p>

<p>Bob had just come through a very extraordinary
adventure, for some time his life had
actually hung in the balance; but he quickly
forgot all about this in the new anxiety about
his brother.</p>

<p>More than once he had to cast about him to
be sure that he was heading the right way.
Somehow, since the fire had burned over the
ground, eating up the masses of dead leaves
and other inflammable growths, things did not
look the same as before.</p>

<p>"But the wind came down from the north,"
he kept saying, as he pushed doggedly on over
the smoking ground; "and that is the way
I'm going back now. Only, I seem to be in a
new part of the forest, things look so different.
But hold on, Bob, there's that cross formed by
two trees that fell toward each other. I remember
that plainly, and it was just after I
left Sandy, too."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>Now he was sure that the hollow tree must
be somewhere close by. He raised his voice,
and called the name of his brother.</p>

<p>"Sandy! Hello! where are you?"</p>

<p>Through the desolate forest, with its blackened
carpet, the sound of his voice came back
to mock him. Nothing else responded to his
hail.</p>

<p>Louder than before he shouted, but there was
no answering call. Bob again felt that terrible
chill in the region of his heart. A brief time
before, and he had been apparently burning
up; now he was shivering.</p>

<p>"There it is!" he suddenly cried, as he happened
to let his wandering gaze fall upon a
tree that seemed to have a gap in its side.</p>

<p>He hurried forward. Even as he advanced
other familiar things greeted him, so that his
last lingering doubt vanished.</p>

<p>"It's the tree, surely," he muttered, straining
his eyes to see within, and almost holding
his very breath lest he discover a motionless
figure in the cavity.</p>

<p>But it was empty!</p>

<p>At least Sandy had not been smothered by
the dense smoke; he must have left his retreat.</p>

<p>"Oh! I hope he stayed here until the worst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
was over!" was the cry that burst from the
boy, as he stood there, staring into the empty
<i>cache</i>, which he had intended to be a means of
life-saving to his brother.</p>

<p>He turned and looked around. There did
not seem to be a living thing in sight. Animals
and birds had all been driven away by the fire,
which was doubtless still rushing through the
woods far to the south.</p>

<p>Was it worth while to call out again? Surely
if Sandy had been within half a mile of him
he must have heard that last shout!</p>

<p>Puzzled, and sorely distressed, Bob hardly
knew what to do. He even looked again into
the hollow tree, as though in that way he might
receive an answer to his question as to what
had become of his brother.</p>

<p>And he did.</p>

<p>For, when he looked down, he saw that there
had gathered quite a quantity of dead wood
within the cavity. It had not dried out since
the last rain, some time before, which must
have driven into the cleft. And plainly he
could see marks there that must have been
made by Sandy!</p>

<p>This gave him an idea, and he wondered why
he had not thought of it before. Of what use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
was his forest training if he could not ascertain
whether Sandy had issued from the tree before,
or after, the fire?</p>

<p>Down he dropped on his hands and knees.
The very first thing he discovered was the
positive impression made by one of his brother's
new moccasins, given to him by Colonel
Boone before the great hunter had said good-bye.</p>

<p>It was plainly made after the fire had passed,
of that Bob felt certain; and the fact gave him
the keenest of pleasure, since it assured him
of Sandy's having passed through the siege unharmed.</p>

<p>But why had he not answered his shouts?
Where could he have wandered to, that he
failed to hear a far-reaching hail, such as the
strong lungs of his brother had sent sounding
through the forest?</p>

<p>Bob began to follow the footprints. At least
Sandy must have intended to seek him, for he
had commenced to chase <i>after</i> the fire.</p>

<p>"Oh!" gasped the boy, suddenly coming to
a stop, and gazing in alarm at some new marks
that met his eyes.</p>

<p>They were also moccasin tracks! More than
that, they seemed to mingle with the smaller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
ones made by Sandy. Bob bent closer, his
heart seeming to leap into his throat as a
dreadful fear clutched him.</p>

<p>One thing he noted that gave him this new
chill&mdash;every one of the new footprints <i>toed
in!</i> He knew what this signified. White men
seldom tread that way, but it is the universal
custom of Indians to walk after the fashion
called "pigeon-toe" as nature undoubtedly
intended should be done.</p>

<p>Then Indians had been here,&mdash;after the fire,
too; and poor Sandy must have fallen into
their hands!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />

<small>CAPTURED BY THE SHAWANEES</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Glory!</span> but that was a hot time!"</p>

<p>Sandy thrust his head out of the hollow tree
as he gasped these words. The fire had swept
past as he crouched there, trying to hold his
breath, and wondering if it would reach into
the aperture and seize hold of his garments.</p>

<p>And now it was gone. He could hardly believe
the truth, and that he had really escaped
without any injury. Down the wind he could
see the angry glow that marked the fire line.
Here and there little blazes still remained, where
a winrow of the dead leaves had offered fat
pickings for the flames. And smoke curled up
everywhere, sickening smoke that made the
eyes smart.</p>

<p>"But what of Bob?"</p>

<p>That was the chief thought that surged
through the mind of the boy as he crouched
there inside his refuge and stared out at the
strange scene.</p>

<p>"Oh! what if he did not find a place to hide?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
What if he was caught in the open? I can
stand this suspense no longer. I <i>must</i> know
the worst!"</p>

<p>As he said this with a quavering voice, he
issued from the tree. The earth was still hot
after its recent burning; but, by picking his
way, Sandy believed that he might find it possible
to walk on in the direction the fire had
swept along.</p>

<p>He called to Bob as he moved. Once his heart
seemed to leap into his mouth, for he thought
he saw something move ahead; but, though he
turned a little aside so as to advance that way,
he failed to see it again.</p>

<p>Then he stopped to consider. Was it wise
for him to wander off in this manner, without
a definite plan? Had not Bob told him to stay
where he was until he came? He might get
lost, and only add to their troubles. Yes, perhaps
he had better restrain his impatience, and
wait a reasonable time to see whether Bob
would not show himself.</p>

<p>It was while he stood thus, close to an unusually
large tree, that something came to pass,
possibly the very last thing in all the world
Sandy was thinking about.</p>

<p>A pair of muscular bronzed arms suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
closed about the boy. Struggling hard, and
twisting his head back, he found to his horror
that he was looking into the painted face of
an Indian warrior.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 337px;">
<img src="images/i223.jpg" width="337" height="500" alt="Indian grabbing boy" />
<div class="caption">"A PAIR OF MUSCULAR BRONZED ARMS SUDDENLY CLOSED ABOUT THE BOY."</div>
</div>

<p>Then he heard the brave give vent to a
screech, which must have been some sort of
signal, for immediately three other feathered
heads popped into view, one of them from behind
the very tree where Sandy had believed
he saw something move.</p>

<p>In vain the boy struggled with all his might;
his strength was not equal to that of the man
who held him, and, when the four ugly looking
red men had gathered around him, the nearest
snatched his musket away.</p>

<p>"Ugh!" grunted his captor, suddenly releasing
his arms.</p>

<p>Sandy stood there in their midst, white and
alarmed, but trying to summon all his resolution.
And, indeed, if ever the boy needed his
courage it was at that moment, when he realized
that he was alone and powerless in the hands
of the hostile Shawanees.</p>

<p>Would they proceed to kill him then and
there? He had heard terrible stories about the
cruelty of these copper-colored sons of the wilderness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>Now they were jabbering away in an unknown
tongue. Occasionally they would point
at him, as though he must be the subject of
their talk, as he had no doubt was the case.</p>

<p>"Oh! I wonder if they really mean to do
it," was what Sandy was saying to himself, as
he listened to the vigorous language, which to
him was utterly without sense, although he felt
sure that Colonel Boone could have understood
every word of it.</p>

<p>Then he saw one fellow, who seemed to scowl,
fingering his tomahawk in a suggestive manner
that made Sandy's very blood run cold.</p>

<p>Thinking he saw a chance to bolt, the boy
suddenly sprinted off. But ere he had gone
twenty feet his arm was clutched in a dusky
hand, and his flight brought to a halt.</p>

<p>At least one of his captors could speak some
English, and he shook his knife in Sandy's
face:</p>

<p>"No run&mdash;paleface boy try more, we kill!"</p>

<p>Sandy managed to pluck up a little fresh
hope. From what the painted brave said, if
he tried again to escape they would do something
desperate. Did that mean they would
let him live if he gave in, and allowed himself
to be made a prisoner?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>The man who gripped him held his hands
behind, while another secured his wrists together
with buckskin thongs. That looked as
though they meant to take him along with them,
perhaps to their village.</p>

<p>And so presently Sandy found himself marching
along over the blackened ground, hedged
in by a quartette of vicious looking Indians.</p>

<p>They paid little attention to him, though if
at any time he seemed to slacken his pace,
which was a jog-trot, such as Indians can keep
up all day, he received, as a gentle reminder
that he was to put on fresh speed, a dig in the
ribs from one of those in the rear.</p>

<p>Sandy never forgot that little excursion.
While he may not have covered a great many
miles, his spirits were so low that it seemed
the most miserable period of his whole life.</p>

<p>What had happened to Bob? That was the
burden of his thoughts. He even found himself
wondering whether his brother could have
fallen in with these red men, and met with disaster.
Then he noticed that one of the four
carried a gun, and that it was such a weapon
as the French traders used in dealing with the
Indians, and not a staunch musket like the English
possessed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>If Bob had escaped both the peril of the fire
and that of the Indians, would he discover what
had happened to his brother and carry the news
home?</p>

<p>By degrees they had edged away from the
burned tract. The wind had died out, and
finally, after crossing a line of flickering flames
that was making but poor progress, Sandy discovered
that they no longer walked through
blackened stuff, but upon leaves that had not
felt the touch of fire.</p>

<p>"Why, there must have been a shower over
this way," he said to himself, noticing that the
ground seemed wet; and that was exactly what
had happened.</p>

<p>He heard his captors exchanging remarks
again, and from their manner guessed that
the end of their pilgrimage must be close at
hand.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is a village they are taking me
to," he said, remembering what he had heard
from Blue Jacket.</p>

<p>Surely that was a dog barking somewhere
ahead. Did the Indians have dogs? Yes, he
remembered that this was so. Blue Jacket had
told him how they had been bred from wolves,
that long ago had been taken captive, so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
they still possessed many of the savage traits
that had marked their ancestors.</p>

<p>And then as they pushed out of the forest
he suddenly set eyes on the Shawanee village.
It stood on the bank of a small stream, no doubt
a tributary to the great Ohio. There were
scores of skin lodges, each one gaudily painted
with rude scenes representing some stirring incidents
in the lives of the braves who owned
them.</p>

<p>In spite of the distressing condition in which
he found himself placed, Sandy could not help
feeling interested in the strange spectacle, for
never before had he so much as looked upon
a genuine Indian wigwam.</p>

<p>He was not allowed to enjoy it long, however.
As soon as the news that a prisoner had been
brought in was circulated among the dusky occupants
of the lodges, the utmost confusion
abounded.</p>

<p>Braves came thronging out to meet the returning
warriors, squaws chattering, papooses
squalling, and even half-naked youngsters adding
to the clamor.</p>

<p>Poor Sandy was pinched and poked and
pushed about at the hands of the throng until
he really feared for his life. Angry looks were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
cast upon him. Apparently there had been
braves who had gone forth from this village
upon the warpath to return no more. They
seemed to want to vent their anger upon the
head of the white boy who had fallen into their
hands.</p>

<p>Sandy was glad when they thrust him inside
a lodge. So roughly was this done that the boy,
rendered partly helpless by his bonds, reeled
and fell on his face on the ground. Fortunately,
however, the earth proved yielding, so that he
was not seriously injured.</p>

<p>Struggling to a sitting position, he tried to
bolster up his courage by remembering all that
he had ever heard about Indian villages from
Pat O'Mara, and also from Daniel Boone himself,
during that day's tramp through the forest.</p>

<p>"And they said that these redskins like to
burn their prisoners at the stake," Sandy whispered
to himself, as he shook his head dolefully.
"Oh! I hope they will never try that! I'm
sure that was roast enough for me in that old
tree. Perhaps now that old hag means to adopt
me. She acted like it, when she threw her
wrinkled arms around me, and jabbered so.
And Colonel Boone told me how he was adopted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
into an Indian tribe, not long ago. She is a
horrible looking old squaw; but better be made
her son than&mdash;the other thing!"</p>

<p>The day slowly died, and Sandy looked to
the coming of night with new terror. He could
not exactly remember whether it was in the
evening or the morning that the Indians always
burned their prisoners.</p>

<p>"It would make some difference if I only
knew," he said, with hope still fluttering in his
boyish heart.</p>

<p>He had some difficulty in creeping to the entrance
of the lodge, but was determined to peep
out again and see if there were any grim signs,
such as the planting of a stake or the gathering
of brush.</p>

<p>"I can see nothing out of the way," he muttered,
after carefully looking as well as the
circumstances allowed.</p>

<p>Fires had been lighted, and the squaws
seemed to be getting a meal ready, though,
from what he had heard, Sandy understood
that the red men have really no set time for
eating, like their paleface brothers; simply
waiting until they are hungry, and then
satisfying the demands of nature with
food.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a scene of bustle, with many dusky
figures flitting about the fires.</p>

<p>"I wonder if I could manage to get away
from here, in case I got my hands free?"
Sandy was saying; but almost immediately he
discovered that close by was a squatting figure,
evidently a guard, for he held a gun in his
hands and seemed to be intently watching the
head of the prisoner.</p>

<p>So Sandy with a sigh drew back and waited
for something to turn up. He was a most disconsolate
figure as he crouched there, anticipating
the worst; yet, while thinking of home and
mother, trying to hope for the best.</p>

<p>Then suddenly he started. Surely that was
not the voice of an Indian he heard! Again he
scrambled to the opening and thrust out his
head.</p>

<p>A neighboring fire lighted up the scene. It
was of unusual size, and the boy immediately
conceived the idea that the Indians meant to
hold some sort of council, perhaps to decide his
fate, for many were gathering around, with
braves in the middle, and the squaws and boys
on the outer fringe.</p>

<p>And standing close by, in earnest conversation
with one who seemed to be something of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
chief, was a man in buckskin, a white man at
that. At first Sandy felt a quick pulsation of
fierce joy. Just to see a white man among all
these dusky sons of the wilderness seemed to
give him fresh courage.</p>

<p>Then a spasm of chagrin passed over him,
for he had remembered the stories told by
Daniel Boone of those renegades, such as
Simon Girty, who had turned their hand
against their kind, and fought side by side with
the savages, more cruel even than the Indians
they had taken to be their brothers.</p>

<p>"But no, he must be a French trader," he
said immediately, as he listened to the voice
of the man in buckskin; "like that Jacques
Larue we met when we stopped at Will's Creek
on the way from Virginia. It is the same!
Yes, now I can see his face plainly. Oh! I
wonder if he would help me get away!"</p>

<p>Filled with this newly-awakened hope the
boy prisoner lifted his voice and called out:</p>

<p>"Monsieur Larue! oh! come this way, if
you please!"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XX<br />

<small>THE COUNCIL FIRE</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Who</span> calls me?" exclaimed the French
trader, looking around him in some surprise.</p>

<p>Evidently, although he must have known that
the Indians had a prisoner, whose fate was to
be decided at the council that was even then
gathering, he could never have dreamed, up to
now, that it was any one who knew him.</p>

<p>"This way, please, monsieur. I am here
in the lodge! Just to your right; now, if you
look down you will see me!" cried Sandy,
eagerly, though, if asked, he could not have
told just why he fancied the Frenchman would
assist him in the least.</p>

<p>"Sacre! what haf we here? A young Eenglish
viper, it seems. Ha! and surely ve haf
before now met! Is it not so?" said the trader,
as by the light of the council fire he saw Sandy's
face.</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, it was at Will's Creek. You remember
we came into the place just before you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
left there, monsieur? You asked my father
ever so many questions about what his business
was. I am Sandy Armstrong, the youngest of
his boys."</p>

<p>"So, zat ees the vay ze vind blows? You
belong to zat Eenglish colony zat mean to cheat
honest men out of zere bread and butter. Worst
of all, you own to being ze son of ze very man
who would take away our trade with ze red
men! Ho! Sandy Armstrong, say you? A
very good evening to you, Sandy. It ees quite
varm, but perhaps not yet so varm as it may
be, eh?"</p>

<p>The words were filled with much more of bitterness
than seemed possible on the surface.
Although he had not yet appealed to the trader
for assistance, Sandy understood that no matter
what he said, it would never touch the stony
heart of the Frenchman. Jacques Larue was
one of those frontiersmen who, having spent
much of their lives amid scenes of turmoil and
violence, could not listen to a plea for mercy,
especially when uttered in an English voice.</p>

<p>"But I am a prisoner here, and these Indians
may mean to put me to death?" the boy
went on, making a last effort to touch the
trader.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>With a shrug of the shoulders the indifferent
Frenchman answered back:</p>

<p>"Zat would be a great pity&mdash;for ze muzzer.
But what would you haf me do? Zese Indians
haf been my good friends. Zey haf lost many
of zere best braves in zat battle with your people.
It is ze habit of ze red men to put prisoners
to ze death. I am sorry for you, boy;
but my business it ees too valuable to reesk it
by offending zese friends. So again, I bid you
ze good evening, young Armstrong."</p>

<p>Trembling with indignation, Sandy cast discretion
to the winds.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know why you will not lift a finger
to try and save me!" he cried aloud; "you
hate my father just because he expects to trade
honestly with the friendly Indians. I have
heard Colonel Boone speak of you and your
breed. You set the redskins against the English&mdash;you
fill them with firewater, and start
them out on the warpath, to burn and murder.
You are like a snake in the grass,
Jacques Larue. And some day the rifle of
a true borderer like Boone will lay you
low!"</p>

<p>The Frenchman could hardly believe his ears.
For a mere youth to brave him thus to his face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
staggered him. He took a step toward the
lodge, and half raised his arm as though
tempted to strike the boy.</p>

<p>"Yes, that would be just like a man of your
stripe, Monsieur Larue. Helpless, a prisoner,
and with my hands tied behind my back, hit
me if it please you!" dared the impetuous lad,
not even deigning to move back into the recesses
of his lodge.</p>

<p>"Sacre! I forgot!" muttered the Frenchman,
bringing himself up with a round turn;
and, whirling on his heel, he strode off toward
the circle of braves.</p>

<p>Presently several warriors were dispatched
to convey the captive to the council ring. One
of them Sandy recognized as the fellow who had
spoken a few words of English at the time of
his capture.</p>

<p>"Cut my hands loose," he pleaded, backing
up to this brave in a suggestive manner.
"Surely you need not be afraid of my running
away. But my arms are so tired of being
cramped in this way. Use your knife, Mr.
Eagle Feather!" for, though he had no idea
of what the name of the brave might be, he
recognized the three feathers in his scalp-lock
as belonging to the king of birds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ugh! paleface boy say true. No danger
run away!" and with the words the other drew
his knife, the same with which he had once
threatened Sandy, across the stout buckskin
thongs.</p>

<p>"That feels better; and thank you for it,"
observed the boy, with a nod, as his hands fell
apart, and he could chafe his numb wrists into
a state of feeling.</p>

<p>"Ugh! paleface boy much brave! Tell Swift
Bullet him fool! Ugh!" said the warrior, as
he took hold of Sandy's right arm, a companion
leading him on the left.</p>

<p>From these few words the boy understood,
first, that the French trader must go by the
name of Swift Bullet among the Shawanees;
second, that the brave had heard all that had
just passed between them; and, last of all, that
possibly he did not chance to bear the best of
feelings toward the French trader, since he evidently
admired the stripling who dared defy
Larue.</p>

<p>When he found himself in the midst of that
great throng Sandy's heart misgave him.
Every face around the triple circle of braves
looked dark and forbidding. In fact, aside
from this single warrior who had helped capture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
him, he did not seem to have a single
friend in the village.</p>

<p>The French trader was present, sitting cross-legged
beside the head chief. He smiled most
of the time, as though simply amused at what
was going on. Evidently Jacques Larue cared
precious little whether the council decided
upon the death of the young English pioneer
or not. He looked upon all such as a breed of
vipers, to be treated with scant ceremony whenever
encountered.</p>

<p>Of course Sandy could not understand what
was said, so far as words went; but there was
no mistaking the gestures of the speakers, some
of which were passionate and striking. They
were calling for his blood! Those who had
fallen in battle must be avenged. Boy or not,
he belonged to the hated English, and was not
their country, given to them by the Great
Spirit, being invaded by these bold compatriots
of Boone and Harrod?</p>

<p>Those very names were mentioned, and by
Indian lips. Somehow, in his great extremity,
the imperilled lad seemed to draw new inspiration
from just hearing that magical name
of Boone. He noted that every time the chief
uttered it there was an uneasy movement that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
passed through, the entire assemblage; while
many a head was half turned, as though a sudden
fear had sprung into being lest the famous
borderer make his appearance there before
them, demanding that the prisoner be released.</p>

<p>What manner of man could this be, that even
the mention of his name should cause a shiver
to pass through an Indian council?</p>

<p>"I believe they're going to do it!" Sandy
whispered to himself, when he saw how still
more threatening looks were cast upon him.</p>

<p>Then came the medicine man, dressed in most
fantastic garb, and wearing a head of a bear,
that had attached to it the horns of a buffalo.
Into the circle he danced, waving his hands,
and crooning some weird song that seemed to
hold his hearers entranced, though to Sandy it
sounded like the worst gibberish he had ever
heard.</p>

<p>But soon he, too, was following the movements
of the old charmer with deepest anxiety;
for it became impressed upon his mind that,
after all, much depended on what he might decide.
The medicine man was believed to be in
direct communication with the Great Spirit,
and could, after certain incantations, learn
what the will of the Manitou might be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>If he said that the prisoner must be burned,
nothing could save Sandy. On the contrary,
should the medicine man declare that the voice
of Manitou declared that some other fate be
meted out to the paleface captive, his word was
law.</p>

<p>Just then Sandy had his attention called to
a movement in another quarter.</p>

<p>"Oh! there is the old squaw who hugged
me!" he exclaimed, almost holding his breath
in suspense; "and she seems to be wanting
to jump forward when the right time comes.
All may not be lost. Perhaps I could never
love her; but I'd be grateful if she saved my
life!"</p>

<p>Once the boy had been seized with a sudden
hope, and had eagerly scanned each and every
face in all that triple circle.</p>

<p>"No, he is not here," he muttered in a disappointed
tone; "perhaps he never got back
home. Perhaps his wound broke out again,
and he fell by the way! Such hard luck!"</p>

<p>He was thinking of Blue Jacket, the young
brave whom he and Bob had nursed back from
the border of the grave. But Blue Jacket was
certainly not there; or, if so, realizing his inability
to help his young white friend, he kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
his face hidden in his blanket of buffalo
skin.</p>

<p>And now the dancing medicine man's movements
grew more rapid. He whirled his arms
more violently above his head, and the various
metal ornaments which were hung about his
person jangled not unmusically, adding to the
weird aspect of the scene.</p>

<p>Apparently he had reached a point where
he was about to launch his decision at the waiting
warriors. Just then the harsh voice of a
squaw was heard, and the old woman whom
Sandy had noticed jumped into the ring, speaking
eagerly, and making all sorts of impressive
gestures with her talon-like hands.</p>

<p>The prisoner shuddered as he gazed; but
something like gratitude entered his heart.
Repulsive as she appeared, the old squaw was
trying to save his life!</p>

<p>He watched the actions of the medicine man
closely, as though he could tell in that way
whether the request of the bereaved squaw
would be granted, and the prisoner turned over
to her to take the place of the son who would
never again bring home to her lodge a share
of the spoils of the hunt.</p>

<p>Then the boy's very heart seemed to turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
cold. Something about the manner of the entire
assemblage seemed to say that the sentiment
of the council was adverse. And doubtless
the wily old medicine man usually gave
the answer just as he saw it expressed on the
faces of the warriors!</p>

<p>They would condemn the prisoner, then, to
be put to death! Brave lad though Sandy had
shown himself on more than one occasion, he
might easily be pardoned for experiencing a
cold chill when the truth broke upon him.</p>

<p>He seemed to feel a choking sensation in his
throat, as though he could hardly breathe.
Somehow, just at that moment his mind flew
far away to the bank of the great Ohio, to a
new cabin he could picture, where a grieving
woman sat beside the large fireplace, and there
was an empty stool at the rough table.</p>

<p>"Mother!" he whispered, softly.</p>

<p>And then he shut his teeth hard. At least
they should not see him quail, these copper-colored
men of the wilderness. Always had he
heard that, above everything else, Indians admired
bravery. When death in its more terrible
aspect faced them, they pretended to show
utter contempt, laughing their enemies in the
face, and mocking them with their last breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, he was an Armstrong! They had ever
been a hardy race, and across the water had
always taken a share in all the wars that rent
Old England. He would show that, though
but a boy in years, he had inherited the spirit
of his ancestors. Not one groan, not one cry
for mercy, would they hear falling from his
lips!</p>

<p>The squaw ceased to implore. She had
fallen back to wait for the decision of the wizard,
who was once again beginning to wave
his arms about, and fix his mincing steps to
keep time with his singsong words.</p>

<p>Sandy was keeping his eyes glued upon the
swaying figure. There was a sort of fascination
about it all, just as though his own life
did not hang in the balance.</p>

<p>"It's coming!" he muttered, presently, as
he saw the heads of the warriors inclined
eagerly toward the magician.</p>

<p>Sandy was conscious of a little confusion
near by. He could not tear his eyes away from
the dancer long enough to ascertain what it
meant. Perhaps some prowling dog had been
caught by a squaw stealing from her lodge,
and was being soundly kicked and berated in
consequence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>The sounds were really coming closer. Loud
voices could be heard, excited voices too, but
in the Indian tongue. Sandy was not much
interested, because he fancied that it was only
some late comers, who were demanding to be
told what the council was about, not knowing
of the capture of a white.</p>

<p>Now he could not help noticing, because
there was a swaying of the outer lines, where
the squaws and boys congregated. Louder
grew the voices. Even the medicine man
paused in the act of delivering the decree of
Manitou, and every face was turned toward
the quarter whence the growing clamor
sounded.</p>

<p>And as Sandy, half starting to his feet,
stared, and held his breath, he saw a figure
he knew only too well come limping into the
lighted arena.</p>

<p>It was Blue Jacket!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI<br />

<small>TIT FOR TAT</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Yes</span>, it was Blue Jacket, but apparently a
wreck of the young Indian whom Sandy had
last seen under the friendly roof of the new
Armstrong cabin.</p>

<p>He was blackened with smoke, his buckskin
garments showing holes that the forest fire had
burned; the proud feather that had once
adorned his scalp-lock hung low over his ear,
and broken; he seemed hardly able to drag himself
past the wondering squaws, and reach the
centre of the triple ring of warriors.</p>

<p>But it was Blue Jacket, alive and in the flesh,
for all that.</p>

<p>"Glory! he has come home just in time to
save me!" Sandy kept saying to himself, as
he stared. "And that terrible old medicine
man was going to seal my fate! Glory! could
there be any greater luck? And didn't dear
old Bob say the bread we cast upon the waters
might return ere many days? Yes, it has come
back, principal and interest!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>Every eye was fastened upon the figure of
the young brave. Not one present at the council
fire but knew he had a story to tell that
would thrill their souls. Even the squaws, seldom
allowed to listen to the serious councils
around the sacred fire, bent forward, the better
not to lose a single word.</p>

<p>Blue Jacket began to speak. At first his
manner was sedate. He was telling of how he
had fought in that night battle, of the wound
that had left him on the field and how he crept
away, hoping to return to his lodge among his
people.</p>

<p>Then Sandy, who could fairly interpret from
his manner, knew that he spoke of finding himself
alone, weakened from loss of blood, and
unable to even call for assistance.</p>

<p>Expecting to become the prey of wild beasts
during the night, he had, with the stoicism of
the red man, awaited the end calmly. Then
came the paleface boys. His bronzed face
lighted up as he told how they tenderly carried
him to the brow of the hill overlooking the
river, and cared for his wounds.</p>

<p>Now he became dramatic in his recital, and
held his hearers spellbound. Surely he was
speaking of that white mother now, telling how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
she advised that he be cared for and made well.
It was such a revelation, so entirely different
from all that the savage Indian nature understood,
that the old men wagged their heads
from time to time, and looked at one another
helplessly.</p>

<p>Blue Jacket went on. Now he was telling
of one paleface warrior who had sought his life,
and how those boys stood between. Sandy
guessed this. He was hanging on the excited
words of the young Shawanee just as though
he could fully grasp the full sense of the harangue.</p>

<p>Suddenly Blue Jacket ceased. Striding forward
as well as his lame leg would permit, he
threw a protecting arm across the shoulders
of Sandy, as he faced once more the throng of
red men.</p>

<p>"My brother!"</p>

<p>That was all he said, but his manner told the
story. He stood ready to sacrifice his life, if
need be, to save this paleface lad from the
stake. Simple, yet eloquent beyond description,
was his attitude as he thus stood there.</p>

<p>Would his will prevail? Had his rough eloquence
reached the hearts of those sons of the
wilderness?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>In years to come the name of Blue Jacket
was fated to pass into the pages of history as
a famous Indian orator, who could sway the
minds of his people as few others were able.
And in this fierce harangue, delivered in his
youth, he made a reputation as a leader which
was to follow him in all after years.</p>

<p>The old men exchanged looks. They nodded
their heads gravely.</p>

<p>"I surely believe he has turned the scale!"
breathed the anxious Sandy, noting these significant
signs.</p>

<p>The shrewd old medicine man could not always
foretell the weather; but he was able to
discern a sudden change in the wind of popular
approval. Before this dramatic coming of the
young and wounded brave he knew the consensus
of opinion ran strongly toward putting
the prisoner to the stake. It was different
now!</p>

<p>And so the wily old fellow once more started
his incantations and whirlings, just as though
he were taking them up at the point where he
had been interrupted; but with a decided difference
that even Sandy could notice.</p>

<p>His manner now was not fierce and ugly;
he no longer made swift downward strokes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
with his extended arms, but extended them upward
in a beseeching manner, as though imploring
Manitou to have mercy.</p>

<p>Then, after a supreme exhibition of his powers,
with a great rattling of wampum belt, and
jangling metal discs that were strung about
his person, he moved over to where Sandy
stood, with the dusky protecting arm of Blue
Jacket still flung about his shoulders.</p>

<p>Holding his hands above the white prisoner,
the medicine man uttered a string of words,
amid much bobbings of the head. Although
he could interpret not a single expression,
Sandy knew full well that in this way the wizard
was declaring he had been taken under the
especial charge of the Great Spirit, and that
henceforth no Shawanee hand should be raised
against a member of the Armstrong family.</p>

<p>The French trader had listened to all this
with a sneer on his lips, while his face grew
dark as though it pleased him not a bit.</p>

<p>Sandy had little discretion, as we have seen
more than once. With his usual impetuosity
he could not restrain himself from flashing a
look of triumph toward Jacques Larue. The
trader saw it, and gritted his teeth. After that,
he would doubtless feel more than ever a vicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
spite against anything that bore the
brand of an Armstrong.</p>

<p>"Come!" said Blue Jacket, leading Sandy
away.</p>

<p>"With the greatest of pleasure," replied
that worthy, feeling as though a tremendous
weight had been taken from his shoulders, as
indeed was the case.</p>

<p>The young Shawanee led his white brother
to his lodge, where an old squaw, his mother
undoubtedly, proudly awaited them. Nothing
was too good for the paleface who had saved
the life of her boy. But first of all, Sandy insisted
upon the wounds of the young warrior
being dressed.</p>

<p>"You must have been caught in the fire, too,
Blue Jacket!" he declared, as he noted the
condition of the warrior's scanty garments,
which at least had been whole at the time he
was in the new settlement.</p>

<p>"Much time, Sandy. Near gone when reach
creek and dive in!" replied the other, simply.</p>

<p>And that was all he could be persuaded to
say about his adventure, yet Sandy felt positive
that the young brave must have gone
through a thrilling experience, with the fire
surrounding him, and wounded in the bargain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
He could picture what Blue Jacket declined to
relate.</p>

<p>"They have spared my life, Blue Jacket,"
observed the white boy, after a time, when he
had assisted the squaw to bind up the reopened
wound of the brave once more; "but do they
mean to keep me here a prisoner? Am I to
never see my people again&mdash;dear old Bob,
Kate, father, and my mother?"</p>

<p>The budding warrior looked at him, and actually
a faint smile came upon his face. Sandy
could not remember having ever seen him show
so much feeling before.</p>

<p>"You wait, Sandy," he said in a low voice;
"leave that to Blue Jacket. Give word Bob
you be free. Me no fail! Never forget him
mother, not much!"</p>

<p>But Sandy had caught one word that riveted
his attention.</p>

<p>"When did you promise Bob to save me?
Where did you see him, Blue Jacket?" he demanded,
eagerly.</p>

<p>"Me leave since sunset. Bob fix best can,"
and saying this the young Indian pointed down
at his injured limb.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that you have been with my
brother since the fire?" cried Sandy, his face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
lighting up with a great joy, for that would tell
him Bob could not have been injured in the
forest conflagration, as he had greatly feared.</p>

<p>Blue Jacket nodded gravely in the affirmative.
English words did not come readily to
his lips, and, when he could make a gesture
take their place, he seldom failed to do so.</p>

<p>"Bob find in creek. Him help 'long. Leg
bad; much limp. Blue Jacket make like papoose.
Get here just in time. Not much good.
Ugh!" he grunted.</p>

<p>"Then Bob came along with you?" persisted
Sandy, determined to drag the whole
truth out by degrees.</p>

<p>"Come 'long, yes. No think safe enter village.
Hide in woods. Wait till fox him bark
three times. Bob know. Bob safe!"</p>

<p>"Hurrah! that's good news you're telling
me, Blue Jacket!" exclaimed Sandy, exultantly.
"So Bob is safe, and near at hand
right now! Why, he never even went back to
the settlement to tell the story, and get assistance.
Surely he is a brother to be proud of.
Tell me, Blue Jacket, did he send any message
by you? Have you got any of the white man's
writing to give me?"</p>

<p>Whereupon the other gravely drew something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
from the bosom of his torn hunting shirt,
and extended it to Sandy.</p>

<p>"Me forget. Bob say all right. No can
understand spider crawl on bark. Sandy know.
Bob tell," he said quaintly.</p>

<p>There were not many words, and these had
been scratched by some sharp-pointed flint, so
that it was only with an effort that the boy
could make them out by the light of the fire in
front of the lodge.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sandy</span>:&mdash;Keep up a brave heart. We are
going to get you out of there to-night. Trust
Blue Jacket. He is true as steel. Bring gun.</p>

<div class='sig'>
"<span class="smcap">Bob.</span>"<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>Sandy smiled as he saw that reference to the
old musket; and yet, after all, it was not so
strange that cautious, wise Bob should remember
how much of their anticipated pleasure in
hunting during the months that were ahead
would be taken away if Sandy were without a
weapon.</p>

<p>He read the message aloud to his friend.
Blue Jacket evidently saw nothing singular
about that mention of a gun. He knew what
it meant to be without the means of obtaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
food in that great wilderness. What bow and
arrows, a tomahawk, or a crude knife, meant to
an Indian, a gun stood for in the eyes of a
white man. And so Blue Jacket only nodded
his head gravely as he listened, saying finally:</p>

<p>"Get gun all right. No fear. Much skins
here. Swap with brave for gun. Go now."</p>

<p>He evidently believed in striking while the
iron was hot, for, stooping down, he gathered
in his arms several valuable skins, among them
some beautiful otter pelts, and started out.</p>

<p>The squaw never raised a finger to interfere,
yet she knew that Blue Jacket was very
weak and sore from his tremendous exertions
in trying to escape from the pursuing fire.
And she was his mother, too. But then Sandy
realized that Indian mothers differed in many
respects from those of white boys. Blue
Jacket, was he not a warrior now, and as such
fully competent to decide for himself? The
old squaw no doubt would have held her tongue
had he declared it to be his intention to start
back to the white settlement with Sandy, even
though she knew it must be the means of bringing
about his death.</p>

<p>Sure enough, Blue Jacket must have gauged
well the temper of the brave who had obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
the old flintlock musket, and knew just how to
wheedle him out of his recent prize, for, when
the young Indian returned, he placed in Sandy's
eager hands not only the gun, but all
other things taken from the prisoner at the
time he fell into the hands of the four Shawanee
warriors&mdash;his powder horn, carved
with considerable rude skill by Bob, the bullet
pouch decorated with colored porcupine quills,
his hatchet, knife, and even the little bag, in
which Sandy was accustomed to keeping his
flint and steel, some dry tinder for starting
fires, and a few trifling odds and ends.</p>

<p>"Why, my brother!" cried the delighted
white boy, "you are a bigger medicine man
than the old fellow who danced, and shook
those hollow gourds with the dried beans inside.
Here are all my belongings, with not one
thing missing. Oh! I tell you, it was a fine
day I discovered you there in the grass, Blue
Jacket. For you have returned what little we
did a dozen fold!"</p>

<p>But evidently the young Indian had his own
ideas about that, for he shook his head, and
made a grimace. He would never forget how
those boys had stood between when the irate
settler, Anthony Brady, demanded his blood!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>"No can repay. Armstrong name never can
forget. You see. To-night we go away. Bob
wait to show way home. Blue Jacket him not
able go far. Much sorry!" he said, as he
limped about the lodge to try his poor limb.</p>

<p>But Sandy gripped the Shawanee's hand,
while his boyish face fairly beamed with the
affection he felt toward the gallant young savage.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII<br />

<small>THE ESCAPE</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">When</span> can we go, Blue Jacket?" asked
the boy, with his usual impatience.</p>

<p>"No can get away yet some time. Sandy
look out," came the reply.</p>

<p>"Well, I see what you mean," admitted the
prisoner, reluctantly. "There does seem to
be considerable of a stir around. Everybody
is moving about. Even the dogs seem to be
prowling around sniffing at things."</p>

<p>"Ugh! much stir. Talk heap. French
trader try to palaver with chiefs. Make think
English bad men. Steal Indian country, kill
squaws, papooses, all. Ugh!" and, from the
way Blue Jacket said this, it was evident that
he feared the influence of the smooth-voiced
Jacques Larue would undo all the good his
harangue had accomplished.</p>

<p>Not that his people would think of putting
Sandy to the stake. That bugbear had been
effectually squelched after he had told how
kind the two Armstrong boys had shown themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
to him. But they might refuse to let
the prisoner go free, demanding that he be
forced to join the tribe. The lodge was still
to be a prison, for the squaw had betaken herself
off, and Blue Jacket had said he would not
be allowed to stay with his white brother.</p>

<p>Even Sandy understood something of his
danger. Perhaps it had to do with his impatience
to get away from the village, with its
clamor and its strange inhabitants.</p>

<p>He remembered the skinny old crone who
had wanted to adopt him as her own son. She
meant it all in kindness, perhaps, but the very
thought made poor Sandy shiver.</p>

<p>"But look here, Blue Jacket, what about
Bob?" he said, presently, after he had turned
away from peeping out at the exit of the lodge.</p>

<p>"Bob wait," replied the Indian with his customary
taciturnity.</p>

<p>"Yes, but when time passes, and I fail to
come, he may get impatient and do something
that will get him into trouble?"</p>

<p>At this the young Indian shrugged his shoulders.
Perhaps he had caught the manner from
the French traders, oily men who often visited
the Shawanees in their villages to barter poor
guns and powder for their valuable pelts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>"Bob no Sandy!" was his only comment;
and it struck home, too, for the one who heard
gave a little chuckle, as he hastened to reply:</p>

<p>"You are right about that, Blue Jacket; and
perhaps it's just as well that he is not. One
hothead in the family is quite enough. But
you think, then, Bob will bide his time patiently,
and wait to hear from you?"</p>

<p>"Him say," answered the other, calmly.</p>

<p>"Oh!" observed Sandy; but he saw a
great light.</p>

<p>It told him what a distinct impression that
sober brother of his must have made on the
observing young Indian during the week of
their intercourse. Accustomed to reading people
just as Sandy might the pages of a printed
book, Blue Jacket knew that, when Bob Armstrong
said a thing, that was just what he
meant. His simple word was, in the eye of
this native of the woods, as good as another's
bond.</p>

<p>Presently Sandy spoke again, for he could
not keep his mind long off that fascinating
subject.</p>

<p>"Is he near the border of the village, Blue
Jacket?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Much close. Blue Jacket him hide Bob.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
No can find. P'raps dog smell him. Not much
danger that. You wait. Sleep. Time come
bimeby. Blue Jacket crawl in lodge, wake.
Make not noise, but move like snake. Ugh!"</p>

<p>With that the young Indian abruptly left
him.</p>

<p>Sandy threw himself down on the blanket
and bearskin which he found in his prison.
Perhaps what the Indian suggested would be
a wise thing for him to do. He was very tired,
and trembling with excitement. Of course, he
hardly hoped to sleep any; but even lying there
would rest him more or less.</p>

<p>But, despite his fears, he must have passed
away into dreamland very shortly after dropping
on the soft robes, for he could not remember
doing any great amount of thinking over
his past troubles and the uncertain future.</p>

<p>A cold hand touching his face awakened
him.</p>

<p>Before he could utter a sound he heard a low
hiss that warned him against making a single
exclamation. It was well Blue Jacket adopted
this course, because naturally Sandy supposed
himself safe at home, in his own newly-fashioned
bed, and that it was Bob who had disturbed
his dreams.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>Instantly he understood. The skin lodge
was almost in darkness. Still, something of a
flickering light seeped in through little openings
at the entrance; and he could just manage
to make out a bending figure that crouched
beside him.</p>

<p>"Is it you, Blue Jacket?" he whispered
softly, as his hand went out to feel of this
figure.</p>

<p>Again that warning hiss greeted him. Then
there was a gentle pull at his buckskin tunic,
which Sandy could not mistake. His ghostly
visitor wanted him to follow his lead.</p>

<p>Expecting some such summons, Sandy had
made all preparations for a quick departure.
His precious gun was lying close beside him;
moreover, he had secured powder-horn, bullet
pouch, and all other belongings, so that nothing
would be left behind.</p>

<p>Blue Jacket turned and crawled away. To
Sandy's surprise the young Shawanee did not
head toward the opening of the lodge; but
common sense told him why. There was a fire
still burning out there, and possibly some brave
might awaken just at the critical moment when
they were passing.</p>

<p>Evidently Blue Jacket had crept in at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
rear, and meant to return the same way. He
knew the possibilities of his own wigwam.
Sandy wriggled his body under the tightly
drawn skin that, with its fellows, formed the
wigwam. He could just barely see the figure
of his guide moving off ahead. And, when
Blue Jacket had said they must glide like the
snake that goes upon its belly, he certainly hit
the truth, for Sandy could not discover the
slightest movement of either arms or legs.
Still the other made fair progress.</p>

<p>Between lodges, avoiding the smouldering
fires, they went. Surely the red guide must
have figured every inch of the route in advance.
Not even a dog seemed to be along the course;
and Sandy's admiration for his friend increased
by bounds with every yard that they
advanced.</p>

<p>He had been wise enough to observe the
location of Blue Jacket's lodge, and hence knew
that they were now heading in a general way
toward the bank of the small stream near
which this temporary hunting camp of the Shawanees
had been located.</p>

<p>This gave him a sudden and brilliant idea.
Bid Blue Jacket mean that they should make
their escape by water? It would save many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
weary miles of tramping, which task Sandy
was not in very good physical condition to
undertake.</p>

<p>More than once the dark figure ahead came
to a pause, and lay as still as a log. Sandy
was keenly awake to the situation, and copied
his actions to the letter. On one occasion a
couple of dogs came running past, having evidently
been hunting on their own account in
the forest. They stopped to sniff the air, but
luckily they were not on the windward side of
the crouching figures; and so the presence of
a paleface was not discovered; for soon they
went on among the lodges, to lie down and rest
after their long chase.</p>

<p>Another time it was a moving warrior who
caused alarm. But he seemed to have only
been down to the river for a drink, for he
walked past the spot where the two shadows
lay without any suspicion that anything was
amiss.</p>

<p>It was an exciting time for poor Sandy,
and his heart seemed to be up in his throat
with suspense as he kept his agonized eyes fastened
on that tall, dusky figure, until it was
lost among the neighboring lodges.</p>

<p>All now seemed well, and the coast clear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
Rapidly Blue Jacket advanced. No longer was
he content to wriggle like the rattlesnake. He
had first arisen to his knees, and finally to his
feet. True, he limped sadly, and Sandy knew
that, with an Indian's stoicism, his guide must
be repressing the groans that a white boy
would have uttered.</p>

<p>"He's game, all right," Sandy was saying
to himself, filled with gratitude toward the
young Indian; "good Blue Jacket! Will I
ever forget this? May my right arm wither
if I should! And now, I wonder where Bob
is?"</p>

<p>They had gone some little distance from the
village, so that there no longer seemed to be
any danger that they would be seen if they
walked erect. Sandy had impulsively thrown
an arm about his companion, meaning to help
him. Perhaps at another time the proud young
Shawanee might have indignantly declined to
accept any assistance; but he was weak, and
he had learned to feel a singular affection for
his two white brothers.</p>

<p>They came to a stop near a tangle of
thickets.</p>

<p>"Listen!" said Blue Jacket.</p>

<p>Then close by, so that it actually startled the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
white boy, came the bark of the red fox, twice
repeated. And he remembered what his guide
had said about the signal which Bob was to
recognize. Anxiously Sandy waited, every
nerve on edge for fear lest his brother might
have gone.</p>

<p>There was a stir in the thicket, and then
came a low voice saying:</p>

<p>"Sandy! Blue Jacket, is it you?"</p>

<p>"Here!" exclaimed the escaped prisoner,
unable to longer restrain his feelings; and in
another moment he was clasped in a brother's
sturdy embrace.</p>

<p>"No time lose," observed the practical Indian.
"Come long me. River close by. Canoe
p'raps wait. Paddle home. Tell white
squaw Blue Jacket much glad."</p>

<p>In two minutes they had arrived at the border
of the little stream, where Blue Jacket produced
his canoe, hidden for this very purpose
late that evening.</p>

<p>"Go quick! No time lose. Mebbe alarm
come. Who can tell?" said the Indian.</p>

<p>Sandy had crept into the frail boat made of
skins, and Bob was about to do so, after squeezing
the hand of their red friend, when a smooth
voice suddenly said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sacre! it ees just as I thought when I saw
him paddle his canoe here. Not so quick,
young messieurs. You are not yet out of ze
woods."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXIII<br />

<small>A CANOE TRIP IN THE STARLIGHT</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was Jacques Larue!</p>

<p>The keen-eyed and suspicious French trader
had by chance seen Blue Jacket slip away from
his people and silently paddle his canoe down
the river a short distance. He had followed,
and watched him hide the bark here in the
rushes bordering the shore.</p>

<p>And of course the trader had no difficulty in
guessing what this meant. He knew Blue
Jacket intended that the white prisoner should
escape by this means.</p>

<p>Why Larue did not go at once to the head
men, and tell of his discovery, will never be
known. Perhaps he fancied that Sandy would
come alone to the boat, and it struck him as a
fine chance to frustrate the designs of the boy
just when doubtless his heart would beat high
with hope.</p>

<p>At any rate here he was, possibly somewhat
surprised that three dark figures confronted
him instead of one shrinking lad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>"What would you?" demanded Bob, turning
quickly around, just as he was in the act
of entering the canoe, which was floating
among the rushes.</p>

<p>"So, you are zere, too, it seems?" sneered
the man. "I remember zere was also ze second
Armstrong cub. Zis is vat I call neat.
Two new Shawanee boys, adopted into ze tribe!
Perhaps ze new Eenglish trader like to exchange
hees goods for sons! Sacre! suppose
you come back to lodges wiz me. I haf got ze
gun pointed straight; and my fingair, it press
on ze trigger. You refuse, and pouf! bang,
down you go!"</p>

<p>"What! do you mean that you would force
us to go back to captivity; and you a white
man at that? Shame on you, Jacques Larue!
Better paint your face, and stick feathers in
your hair; for you are more savage than the
reddest Indian!" cried the reckless Sandy.</p>

<p>The trader gave vent to a low cry of anger.
Bob feared that the Frenchman might be urged
to shoot by these taunts, for he was undoubtedly
hot-blooded, like most of his countrymen.</p>

<p>It was surely a time for action. The young
pioneer made a sudden lunge forward and
struck out with his right arm. Long handling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
of the axe had given Bob the muscles of an
athlete; and when his clenched fist came in
contact with the jaw of the French trader the
result was disastrous to Larue.</p>

<p>He went floundering on his back. His gun
was discharged; but the missile that it had
contained did no more damage than to shoot
a hole through the atmosphere, for it was
aimed at the time at the sky.</p>

<p>"Away!" cried Blue Jacket, pushing Bob
toward the boat; for the boy had acted as
though tempted to follow up his one blow by
giving the insulting trader the whipping he
deserved.</p>

<p>Prudence prevailed, and Bob hastened to
leap aboard. Then the young Shawanee gave
the canoe a shove that sent it out through the
rushes, and upon the bosom of the flowing
stream.</p>

<p>Jacques Larue struggled to his feet, and
wildly pranced up and down on the shore,
shouting threats of what he would do if ever
he came in contact with either of those Armstrong
"cubs" again. But Bob gave little
heed to what he said, being much more concerned
with other matters.</p>

<p>Of course the report of the heavily-charged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
gun, together with the cries of the angry
French trader, must by this time have aroused
the village.</p>

<p>"I wonder if they will pursue us?" ventured
Sandy, as he worked away valiantly at
the paddle which he had taken up.</p>

<p>"The current of this stream is swift, and
the shores so filled with underbrush that we
can make faster time than any brave could
afoot," remarked Bob, while he, too, bent to
the task before him, so that the little boat
fairly danced along on the starlit stream, heading
down toward the junction with the big
Ohio.</p>

<p>"But they have other canoes, for I saw
three at least?" ventured Sandy.</p>

<p>"But Blue Jacket knew that," returned the
other, shrewdly; "and depend on it he saw
to it that they were hidden away where they
could not be found in a hurry. We may be
pursued, but I am not afraid."</p>

<p>They could hear some sort of hubbub taking
place back toward the place where the village
stood. No doubt the greatest confusion ensued
when the absence of all the canoes was
discovered.</p>

<p>"I only hope he will not be made to suffer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
for what he did," mused Sandy; "because
Blue Jacket is our red brother now, and he
thinks a heap of you, Bob."</p>

<p>"Yes, and of you, too, Sandy, because he
said as much. How nice it has all turned out
after all! And it pays, sometimes, brother,
just as our mother says, to be kind toward an
enemy. If we had let the poor fellow die, think
what would be your condition to-night."</p>

<p>Sandy worked for a long time in silence;
but he was undoubtedly thinking over the stirring
events of the last few hours, and the lesson
must have sunk deep into his heart, never
to be forgotten.</p>

<p>"I believe we are close to the big river!"
remarked Bob, after a time.</p>

<p>"Why, you took the very words out of my
mouth," returned Sandy; "for I can see much
water ahead, and the waves seem to be getting
larger. We must keep to the right, and paddle
close to the shore."</p>

<p>Presently they entered upon the vast expanse
of the Ohio, and their progress became
much slower, since now they were compelled
to fight against a strong current, instead of
having the benefit of one.</p>

<p>"Jacques Larue seems to be in mortal fear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
about father taking his trade away from him,"
said Sandy, after a time.</p>

<p>"That is because he has been robbing the
Indians," observed the thoughtful Bob. "He
knows that the English do not trade after that
style, but believe in giving more for the pelts.
And, brother, I believe that what has happened
may assist father very much in his trade. You
heard what the chief said&mdash;that never would
the Shawanees war upon the family of Armstrong.
That means they will be our friends,
even though at war with the whites."</p>

<p>"The skies seem to be brightening all
around," remarked Sandy. "If only the truth
would come out about that barn burning! It
is the one black blot on our name, and father
feels it keenly, though he tries to be so brave.
His honor is very dear to him."</p>

<p>"As it should be," cried Sandy. "But
mother never loses hope. Does she not constantly
say that in God's good time all must
be made clear? And I believe that mother
knows best. I keep hoping that some fine day
we shall have news from our old home in Virginia,
and that word will come to tell us father's
name is cleared."</p>

<p>They said no more for some time. Indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
all of their breath was needed in the violent
exertion of forcing the canoe against that current,
running six miles or more an hour.</p>

<p>"Oh! I believe we must be near home
now!" cried Sandy suddenly, pointing with
his extended paddle toward the nearby shore.
"See, that bunch of trees on the hill-top looks
like the one we can look at from our cabin.
Yes, it must be, Bob! Shall we land here, and
climb up?"</p>

<p>"Ten minutes more ought to do it, brother,"
said the other, quietly. "So dip deep, and
push hard. It is nearly over; and think of the
joy of being home again."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes. They must be dreadfully worried
after knowing about that fire. How fortunate
that it did not sweep this way," declared
Sandy, between gasps; for he was very
nearly done up, not having all the rugged physique
of his brother.</p>

<p>"We have much to be thankful for," replied
Bob, working away.</p>

<p>When the time set by Bob had expired the
canoe was turned toward the shore, and the
two landed, securing the frail craft, for they
hoped to have many a trip in it on the broad
bosom of the mighty Ohio.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>After this they mounted the hill. Bob, knowing
that there were always sentinels on duty,
and not wishing to be fired on by mistake, gave
a signal that would be recognized; and presently
they were met by one whom they knew
well, being ushered by the guard into the settlement.</p>

<p>There was a light burning in the Armstrong
cabin, and they could easily understand that
sleepless eyes reigned there. As they drew
near, the door opened, and the two lads saw
a well-known figure appear. It was the anxious
mother who stood there, shading her eyes with
her hand, for a fire burned near by. She had
heard voices that thrilled her soul.</p>

<p>Impulsive Sandy gave a shout and rushed
forward, to be crushed to that loving breast,
and kissed again and again. Then came the
wide-eyed Kate, and the delighted father, to
renew the tender caresses.</p>

<p>Neighbors who had been aroused also flocked
into the Armstrong cabin, eager to hear of the
boys' adventures. So for an hour, or until
nearly dawn, they had to relate the strange
things that had befallen them since leaving
home on that eventful hunt.</p>

<p>Looking around the big room, where the fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
burned so cheerily, and the kettle sang its
home-like tune, Sandy heaved a great sigh of
happiness.</p>

<p>"It's just Heaven to be here!" he said;
and, while his good mother shook her head in
mild reproof at his words, she smiled with
pleasure to realize that her boys thought so
much of their home, humble though it might
be, and devoid of many things others would
deem necessities.</p>

<p>After a warm meal the boys were compelled
to go to bed, and secure some rest, of which
both of them were certainly in sore need.
Later on that day, when the full particulars of
the captivity were told, David turned to his
wife and said:</p>

<p>"Yes, your way was the best way after all,
Mary. See how blessed a return that poor
wounded and almost dying Shawanee has made.
With his life, if need be, he was determined
to repay the debt. And to think that they call
us <i>friends</i>, these red men with whom I expect
to do much trading after a while! Son, that
was surely the best day's work you ever did
when you bound up the wounds of Blue Jacket,
and took him in by our fireside. I will never
forget the lesson, wife. Our bread cast upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
the waters <i>did</i> return, and that before many
days."</p>

<p>And the gentle Mary only said in reply:</p>

<p>"Still have faith that the other cloud will
yet be lifted in good time, David!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV<br />

<small>THE FEATHERED MESSAGE</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Look</span> up there on the roof of the cabin!
What can it be?"</p>

<p>It was about a week after the return of the
two boys from the Shawanee village. During
this time they had made several trips into the
great forest, and never failed to bring home
game, for there seemed a great abundance
around the new settlement on the Ohio.</p>

<p>The men had used their keen-edged axes well,
and the trees were falling fast. It was even
hoped that the small gardens would prove profitable,
and that they might have other crops,
besides the Indian corn that grew so well in
this climate.</p>

<p>The brief visit of Daniel Boone and his comrades
had had one natural effect upon the two
brothers. They began to copy the frontiersman
style of dress, as the best fitted for the life
they expected to lead from this time forward.</p>

<p>Moccasins they had already; but now their
mother was called upon to fashion for her boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
hunting tunics of tanned buckskin, which in
turn were fringed, as had been those worn by
Kenton and the others. Besides, covering for
their legs was made from the same material,
and appeared similarly decorated.</p>

<p>Bob had made a cap for himself out of the
well-tanned skins of several raccoons he had
trapped, with one of the beautifully marked
tails dangling down the back, like that of his
hero, Simon Kenton.</p>

<p>Sandy, on his part, had done the same with
some skins of gray squirrels, also using the
bushy tails to complete the adornment, so that
together the Armstrong boys presented a
hunter-like appearance by the time these various
additions to their wardrobe were completed.</p>

<p>When they appeared in these new outfits
both lads felt that they could now begin to call
themselves pioneers in earnest.</p>

<p>On this particular day Bob and Sandy had
planned a delightful trip up the river in their
canoe, seeking new fields for hunting; and
looking into the possibilities of the region for
the trapping season, that would begin when the
leaves were dropping from the trees in October.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>It was Sandy who had given utterance to
the exclamation with which this chapter opens.
Bob had followed him out of the cabin. The
sun was just peeping above the wooded hills
away off in the east, and they sniffed the early
morning air with delight; but one who could
read the signs of the weather might have seen
something about the coppery hue of that rising
orb that showed that the long delayed Spring
rains would soon burst upon the country.</p>

<p>Seeing where Sandy was pointing, Bob also
looked, and his surprise exceeded that of his
younger brother when he saw the object that
was sticking in the middle of the sloping
roof.</p>

<p>"Why, it is a feathered Indian arrow!" he
cried.</p>

<p>"How strange! And what can that be tied
to it, Bob?" asked the other.</p>

<p>"Here, boost me up and I will get it; then
we can tell all about it," answered Bob, who
did not believe in wasting time in talk when
the solution of the mystery was so easy to
learn.</p>

<p>So Sandy gave him a hand, and the agile
lad quickly gained the low roof; for the new
cabin, while commodious, was only one story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
high, with a low loft above the living room and
just under the roof.</p>

<p>Bob took the arrow from the roof. He seemed
to use more or less vigor in order to extract
the flint head, showing that it had come down
with considerable force after its aerial flight.</p>

<p>"Oh! I remember now," said Sandy, suddenly
arousing.</p>

<p>"What?" demanded the other, as he prepared
to jump to the ground, holding the feathered
missile carefully in one hand.</p>

<p>"Why," said Sandy, eagerly, "something
seemed to arouse me just about daybreak. It
sounded like a stone thrown against the house.
But I thought father was up, and getting the
fire ready, so mother could cook breakfast;
and I went to sleep again. Bob, that must have
been the time the arrow dropped on the roof!"</p>

<p>"Yes, that was the time," answered Bob;
"for the one who held the bow could never
have seen how to aim in the night, even though
there was a moon."</p>

<p>"Aim, do you say, brother? Is it possible
then he meant to stick that arrow in our roof
rather than any other?" demanded Sandy,
startled.</p>

<p>"I surely do believe it. See, here is a message<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
fastened to the shaft by little threads
drawn from the fibre of cane!" and Bob held
up the piece of birch bark, which Sandy now
saw contained various rude designs possibly
drawn with a sharp-pointed eagle quill, dipped
in the juice of the poke berry.</p>

<p>"Blue Jacket!" he exclaimed involuntarily,
for suddenly he remembered that other unique
message which the young Shawanee warrior
had left, at the time he had slipped away from
the cabin of the Armstrongs.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is the plainest thing of all," remarked
Bob, "for you see here at the end
there is what is meant to be the figure of a
man, an Indian, too, for he has feathers in his
hair; and his jacket is daubed with a blue
stain. But what puzzles me is to read these
signs. Come, sit down here. Perhaps two
heads may prove better than one, and you are
quick at such things."</p>

<p>"Oh! if only Pat O'Mara were here now,
how quickly he would read it all," said Sandy,
screwing up his forehead as he scanned the
several lines of strange figures.</p>

<p>"This must mean the sun, all right," remarked
Bob, pointing to the first rude representation
in the line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>They both turned to look at the king of
day as though understanding that the Indian
artist meant to call their attention that
way.</p>

<p>"Well," remarked Sandy, "the old fellow
does look angry this morning. And then the
sky all around has a coppery hue. That must
mean more dry weather, brother."</p>

<p>But Bob shook his head. He had seen something
more in those queer picture paintings
that caught his attention.</p>

<p>"No, I think you are wrong, Sandy," he
observed slowly. "See, here is what he surely
means for rain pouring down. And further
along is what must be the river rushing
along, bank-full. I begin to see what it is,
brother."</p>

<p>"A warning to the white settlers?" said
Sandy quickly.</p>

<p>"What else can it mean? And look at this
figure standing here; what do you make of
him?" asked the other, pointing.</p>

<p>"Oh! I know!" cried Sandy, his face lighting
up. "See how he is decked out with all
sorts of things, bells and such! And in his
hands he holds gourds that contain dried
beans, to rattle when he shakes them. Yes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
that must be the old medicine man I told you
about. But what has he got to do with the
rains?"</p>

<p>"Now I understand it all," declared Bob,
with a smile.</p>

<p>"Then I wish you would tell me," remarked
his brother, "for to tell the truth I don't seem
able to grasp it."</p>

<p>"The old medicine man has been talking
again with the Manitou," said Bob, "and has
learned that the rain will soon come along,
making a flood of the river. Perhaps he knows
this from some sign, like the angry sun; but
he pretends that the information was given to
him from the Great Spirit."</p>

<p>"And Blue Jacket," cried Sandy, "believing
all he says, has thought it worth while to
come all the way over here, lame as he is, to
warn us! That was good of him. He is afraid
some of us may be caught napping. But how
much better if he had only slipped into the settlement,
and talked with us."</p>

<p>"But Blue Jacket is an Indian, with all the
cunning and caution of the red men," Bob replied.
"He knows that all palefaces do not
think alike; and he feared lest a guard should
shoot him on sight. No, I am glad he was wise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
Think how we should grieve if he were killed
in our midst."</p>

<p>"But about the warning? Shall you tell
father, and have him spread the news?" asked
the younger boy.</p>

<p>"To be sure. It can do no harm, even if it
prove to be a false alarm. They will understand
the motive that sent Blue Jacket over
here again. And, Sandy, perhaps father may
want us to give up that long canoe trip we had
planned for to-day."</p>

<p>At that Sandy's face fell.</p>

<p>"Oh! I hope not!" he exclaimed, quickly.
"For I have been looking forward ever so
much to exploring that country away to the
east, and up the river. Pat told us that on the
other shore, above, the game was thicker than
any place he knew. We must get off to-day,
brother! What if the rain does come, we are
neither sugar nor salt, but strong enough to
stand much."</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps father may not think much
of the old medicine man's belief. And, as you
say, surely we are able to take care of ourselves.
I am hoping myself that father may
not forbid our going," said Bob.</p>

<p>So Sandy, with an object in view, made it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
a point, when they told their father of the
strange warning sent by their good friend Blue
Jacket, to speak of the medicine man as a great
fraud, who was certainly not worth considering.</p>

<p>Whether David was influenced by what he
said, or really believed the danger to be over-rated,
he did not offer any particular objections
to the boys' expedition.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" cried Sandy, as they reached
the place where the canoe was hauled up on
the sandy beach. "Now for a jolly paddle up
the river, and a visit to that unknown shore
over the water, where buffalo and deer are as
thick as peas, and asking to be shot."</p>

<p>Bob was not as enthusiastic, although doubtless
he, too, anticipated more or less pleasure
from the excursion. They did not expect to
be back that night, unless their plans miscarried;
but before another sun had set they
meant to at least be on their way homeward.</p>

<p>Soon they were paddling merrily up the
river. There was not a cloud overhead, and
the sun seemed to give promise of exerting
unusual warmth for so early in the season.</p>

<p>"Poor old medicine man," laughed Sandy,
as he glanced around at the bright picture, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
then thought of the warning message. "So
we are to beware of the river's rising wrath,
are we? Seems to be quiet enough just now,
brother!"</p>

<p>"Yes," was all that Bob replied; for somehow
he seemed to have some foreboding of
coming trouble, though he did not want to tell
Sandy of this, lest the light-hearted one laugh
at his fears, which after all might come to
nothing.</p>

<p>About noon they crossed to the other shore.
Out in the middle of the river they found that
it required considerable muscle to keep the
canoe from losing in the fight with the swiftly
gliding, though noiseless, current.</p>

<p>They determined not to land just yet. Sandy
remembered how Pat O'Mara had told about
a certain wonderful cove further up the stream,
where they could hide their boat while they
hunted. Besides, there was less danger of running
across any hostiles the further they went
in the direction of Fort Pitt; since after the
last great Indian battle the red tribes had retreated
westward.</p>

<p>It proved much further than they had been
led to believe from what the Irish trapper had
said; or else progress against that current was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
slower than they had calculated. At any rate,
the hour was not far from sunset when they
finally sighted the cove that was to be their
landing place.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXV<br />

<small>AFLOAT ON THE FLOOD</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Now</span> to land!" cried Sandy, as they turned
the head of the canoe toward shore.</p>

<p>"Less noise, brother," whispered Bob; for
the impetuous one was forever forgetting that
a frontiersman must learn that silence is the
price of safety when in the woods where the
red man dwells.</p>

<p>"But why do you keep looking up at the
sky so much?" went on Sandy. "Just because
it has clouded up, is no sign it will rain.
Have we not heard that all signs fail in dry
weather? And, even if that old humbug of a
medicine man pretends he has had it direct
from Manitou, I see no reason for being
alarmed. Let it rain if it chooses. We can
hunt in wet clothes as well as in dry."</p>

<p>"Surely," replied Bob, pretending to throw
aside his doubts, for he saw no reason why
Sandy should share them; if trouble came they
would know how to meet it.</p>

<p>So they landed in the snug little cove.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>"Shall we stake the canoe out here in the
rushes?" asked Sandy.</p>

<p>"Not this time," replied Bob. "Take hold,
and we will carry it up to that clump of bushes
yonder. It can lie there safe until we come
again."</p>

<p>"Oh!" laughed Sandy, "I see you still believe
the river will rise suddenly, and threaten
to carry off our only means of getting home!"</p>

<p>"Who knows?" replied the other, quite unmoved
by the accusation; "and, if it did
come, we would be very glad that we had taken
time by the forelock. Besides, it is not much
further."</p>

<p>Having secreted the boat and both paddles,
they concluded to go some little way back, to
camp for the night.</p>

<p>"We must do what Pat says all borderers
do when in the enemy's country&mdash;make a very
small fire to cook with, and hide that so that
not even the keenest eye could discover it,"
observed Bob, as they walked on through the
forest, both on the watch for game of any
sort.</p>

<p>"Well, it will be highly amusing, at least,"
admitted Sandy; "though, unless we are
lucky enough to run across game very soon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
we shall have to make our supper off that dried
venison; and that I do not like."</p>

<p>"Hist!"</p>

<p>Bob suddenly caught the sleeve of his brother's
hunting shirt. Following the direction in
which the other seemed to be looking, Sandy
caught a glimpse of some moving object to leeward.</p>

<p>"A buffalo! Two, <i>three</i> of them! Oh! Bob,
what a chance!" he gasped.</p>

<p>The other drew him down instantly, so that
the bushes screened them.</p>

<p>"Now let us crawl up as close as we dare.
When we get within good gunshot we will both
fire at the same time," he whispered in the ear
of his companion.</p>

<p>Bob, as usual, seemed perfectly calm, while
of course the younger boy was fairly quivering
with eagerness. Still, this would not prevent
Sandy from giving a good account of himself
when the time came to shoot, for he always
fired off-hand at any rate, rather than by long
sight, as some marksmen do.</p>

<p>It was fortunate that the wind, what little
seemed to be stirring through the forest just
then, was coming from the feeding buffalo, and
toward the hunters. This prevented the suspicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
animals from scenting their human enemies.</p>

<p>The boys made fair progress, taking advantage
of clumps of bushes, trunks of trees, and
fallen timber.</p>

<p>"Slower," whispered Bob in his brother's
ear. "They are getting uneasy. Notice how
often that old bull throws up his head and
sniffs the air? He trots away, only to come
back again to his family. Now, again forward.
This log will give us a good boost, I think."</p>

<p>"We don't want the old bull," Sandy managed
to say in the other's ear.</p>

<p>"Hardly. He'd be too tough eating. You
take the half-grown calf, and leave the cow
to me," said the older hunter; and then made
a gesture that prohibited further communications.</p>

<p>Presently Bob realized that they had crept
as close as seemed necessary.</p>

<p>He caught the eye of Sandy, and nodded his
head. Knowing what the programme was to
be, for they had gone through it many times
together, the other gradually managed to raise
himself to a position where he had one knee on
the ground. This was an ideal position for
shooting, as it gave him a chance to rest his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
elbow on the other knee, to steady himself at
the final instant.</p>

<p>To Bob it was given to pick the time of firing.
He had to watch closely, in order to make
sure that both animals selected were free from
trees, so that they might not uselessly waste
precious ammunition.</p>

<p>"Shoot!" he said, quickly.</p>

<p>Bang! roared his own heavily-charged musket.
The cow went floundering down, and
never again arose, for Bob's aim had been
true.</p>

<p>Sandy was not quite so fortunate. Just at
the second when Bob gave the word to fire, the
half-grown young buffalo chanced to step behind
a large tree trunk, so that it was out of
the question to dispose of him while standing
still.</p>

<p>With the report the alarmed animals started
to run wildly away. But Sandy had of course
been expecting this, and was quick to shoot.</p>

<p>He gave a shout as he saw the prize fall.
Bob, on his part, was a little worried lest the
bull charge them; but that old worthy was
already in full flight, doubtless in the belief
that the others of his family would rejoin him,
when their little fright, concerning those lightning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
flashes and thunder crashes coming from
the bushes, had died away.</p>

<p>Here was great luck truly. All the game
they could possibly carry home, and within carrying
distance of the spot where the canoe had
been secreted.</p>

<p>They made camp at once. There was no tent
to erect, so when Bob had removed the two
hides, a laborious task even with Sandy's help,
and started to cut the carcasses up, Sandy
erected a lean-to of branches, bark and leaves,
that would serve fairly well in case it did rain.
Then came a little fire, built as Bob directed,
in a cavity, where its light would never be seen
beyond ten paces.</p>

<p>After that supper was begun. And some of
the meat from the young buffalo bull proved
most tender eating.</p>

<p>"Hark!" said Bob, as they were browning
their fourth helping at the end of long wooden
splinters thrust into the ground near the little
mass of red embers.</p>

<p>Sandy made an involuntary dive for his gun,
as he ejaculated:</p>

<p>"What did you hear? Was it the whoop
of an Indian? Have they discovered us after
all?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>"It has begun to rain, that is all," answered
Bob, smiling; for he had heard the first drops
beginning to patter among the dead leaves.</p>

<p>"Is that all? Why, it is hardly worth mentioning.
And you did give me a start, to be
sure. I'm glad we finished our supper before
those clouds took to leaking."</p>

<p>It seemed a trifling thing just then; but in
the end it was freighted with momentous happenings
connected with the fortunes of those
two young pioneers of the Ohio.</p>

<p>Presently the rain was coming down hard,
so that the two lads were only too glad to crawl
under the shelter that had been built.</p>

<p>In less than an hour Sandy was bemoaning
the fact that he had not, while he was about it,
made the wattled roofing twice as thick, as it
would have shed the rain to better advantage.</p>

<p>That was certainly a night they would not
soon forget; and of course it was Sandy who
complained the most, for Bob could take his
punishment in grim silence, Indian fashion.</p>

<p>"When morning comes, we must try to get
home!" declared the younger pioneer, as he
crouched there and shivered.</p>

<p>"We are so wet now that nothing could
make us feel any worse," declared Bob. "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
am going to try to weave a heavier roof, for
the night is hardly half over."</p>

<p>"A good idea," echoed Sandy.</p>

<p>They set to work; and by the time an hour
had gone by, were able to keep the furious rain
from beating in on their guns.</p>

<p>Sleep was entirely out of the question, and
they could only sit there exchanging a few
words to cheer one another up, and praying
for the morning to come.</p>

<p>It seemed never to dawn, and Sandy really
began to declare that it was three nights
wrapped in one, when his brother called his
attention to a faint gray light in the east.</p>

<p>The rain was still falling in sheets, so that
the prospect looked poor indeed. Again was
the voice of Sandy heard, lamenting the fact
that in all likelihood they must go without any
breakfast, which, in the eyes of a growing and
always hungry boy, was next door to a crime.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," said Bob; "just wait until
the day has really come, when we can see
around. Surely there must be dead trees somewhere
close by; and you know how dry the
heart keeps. We have tinder, and we will have
a fire yet."</p>

<p>That promise sustained Sandy, for he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
never remember when Bob gave his word without
keeping it. Nor was it broken in the present
instance. The rain never gave the slightest
sign of stopping, although it must have
deluged the headquarters of the great Ohio,
and caused the river to rise many feet an hour.
But Bob sallied forth, scorning the wet, to return
presently, staggering under a load of fuel
of a resinous nature, and calculated to burn,
despite the storm.</p>

<p>And it did; for soon, when the expert had
applied his flint and steel to the dry tinder, in
the midst of which a little powder had been
dropped, the fire started, and in half an hour
its genial heat did much to chase away the
blues.</p>

<p>It had been built close enough to their shelter
so that the boys could sit and cook pieces of
tender buffalo meat on the end of their reeds.
And for perhaps upward of two hours they
amused themselves in this fashion.</p>

<p>"Now I feel able to carry my share of the
game down to the boat, if you say the word,"
announced Sandy. "And, as I live, I believe
the rain does not come quite as heavily as before.
Let us be on the move!"</p>

<p>Bob was not quite so sure that there would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
be any break in the storm; but on the whole
he could not hold back. Surely the river would
continue to rise for days after such a cloudburst;
and unless they crossed soon they must
stay on the opposite shore a week, perhaps two.</p>

<p>When they reached the bushes where the
canoe had been hidden, the craft was found
just as they had left it.</p>

<p>"We had better tie the packages of meat
and our guns inside the canoe," said long-headed
Bob; "for then, if we happen to be
upset, they will not be lost."</p>

<p>"A good idea," replied his brother. "But
I hope we are not so unlucky as to be turned
over out there," and he cast an apprehensive
look upon the rushing surface of the flooded
Ohio.</p>

<p>Neither of the lads had had any experience
in such an emergency; nor could they be expected
to realize the terrible power that current
possessed. It ran smoothly, and without
any churning, but, once within its grip, it would
require muscles of steel to guide a boat like
the skin canoe belonging to Blue Jacket.</p>

<p>It was already nearly noon. The sky was
leaden, and the rain constantly falling. Surely
the old medicine man of the Shawanees was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
for once having his prophecy bountifully fulfilled.</p>

<p>It was with considerable misgivings that
Bob, yielding to the importunities of his impulsive
brother, decided to enter the frail canoe
and start to cross that churning flood toward
the other shore. Sandy had artfully mentioned
the fact that the little mother would be anxious
about their safety.</p>

<p>"And," he had continued, "we can be heading
toward the other bank all the time, even
if the current does carry us downstream at a
furious rate."</p>

<p>They had not gone a quarter of the way
across before Bob knew they had made a big
mistake. For the little boat was a mere play-thing
in the grasp of the furious current. They
could make progress neither one way nor the
other. All the while they were being swept
along with the speed of a mill-race, held fast
in that overpowering grip of the flood!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI<br />

<small>THE SINKING CRAFT</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">This</span> looks bad!" said Bob.</p>

<p>He had to raise his voice much above the
ordinary, for out there on the river the rushing
water did not seem so silent as the boys
had believed when ashore; and all around them
could be heard the boiling of the flood. Tree
trunks floated around them in all directions,
showing what an unusual thing this sudden rise
of the river must be. There was constant danger
lest one of these tremendous snags sink
the delicate little skin boat; and often the boys
had to use their paddles like mad to prevent
such a catastrophe from happening.</p>

<p>And once, even a more singular peril threatened
them. It was Sandy who made the discovery,
shortly after Bob had uttered the remark
given above.</p>

<p>"Oh! look yonder, brother; whatever can
that be, perched up in that tree-top? It moved
then, and we are getting closer to it all the
while!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>Bob needed only one look to tell him the nature
of the object.</p>

<p>"It is a panther, Sandy," he said, quickly,
and with a shake of his head. "A big cat of
the wilderness; and, as Colonel Boone said,
the thing most to be feared in all the forest,
for it jumps on the hunter from behind. See
his sleek gray sides? And notice how he
swings his long tail back and forth? I do not
think we want to get any closer to the gentleman,
do you, Sandy?"</p>

<p>"See him crouch, Bob!" cried the other
boy, in alarm. "Do you think he means to
jump for the boat? What if he did, and upset
us out here? That would be terrible! Let us
shout together, and scare him, if we can!"</p>

<p>They did so, at the same time working feverishly
to urge the boat further away from the
drifting tree-top, which had come to be the refuge
of the wood's terror.</p>

<p>Bob cast an apprehensive eye at the distance
separating them. Could the animal clear it,
if he decided to jump? Would he dream of
changing his base in the hope of bettering his
condition?</p>

<p>In fact, Bob was just considering whether it
would not be wiser for him to rely on his gun,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
if the priming could be renewed in time, rather
than in the hope of leaving the beast in the
lurch, when Sandy cried out gleefully:</p>

<p>"We're gaining, Bob! Keep paddling like
mad, and we shall make it. Already he hesitates,
and dares not try! A strong pull, a long
pull, and a pull all together now. Hurrah!
who cares?"</p>

<p>It was hard to quench that lad's spirit. And
somehow, even in such a moment of alarm, his
buoyant courage did much to renew Bob's
sinking hopes.</p>

<p>By increasing their pace, already incredibly
swift, down the stream, they had managed to
leave the panther and his tree-top in the lurch.
There was no longer anything to be feared
from that source.</p>

<p>"Are we making any progress at all?"
asked Sandy, who was pretty well exhausted
from his exertions.</p>

<p>"In one direction, yes; but toward the home
shore I'm afraid not at all," was Bob's frank
reply.</p>

<p>"But what shall we do?" cried the younger
boy, in rapidly growing alarm; for by now the
situation was beginning to impress even his
buoyant nature. "We can never keep on like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
this all day, for the river grows constantly
wider, and the flood stronger. Besides, Bob,
I'm afraid the canoe is beginning to leak!"</p>

<p>Now, Bob had known that terrible fact for
some little time, but hesitated to tell his
brother, feeling sure that nothing they could
do would mend matters.</p>

<p>"I have been thinking, Sandy; and there
seems only one chance for us now," he said,
trying to look ahead down the river.</p>

<p>"Oh! I hope you don't mean that we will
have to swim for it!" cried the other, aghast
at the idea of finding himself buffeting the
flood, with either shore far away.</p>

<p>"No, I hope that may not come&mdash;yet
a while, at least. But I was thinking of the
island!" said Bob.</p>

<p>"The island! Oh! how did I come to forget
that?" shouted Sandy, immediately beginning
to show signs of new ambition. "Yes,
that is it, Bob! We must try to land on the
island, if it is still above water."</p>

<p>"Oh!" declared Bob, quickly, "part of it
must be, for you remember it had quite a little
hill on it."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, for I spoke about the splendid
tree that crowned the top, and said how I would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
like to own a cabin up under its shelter. But
perhaps we have gone past the island! That
would be terrible, wouldn't it, Bob?"</p>

<p>"Surely. But I am positive that is not true.
I am looking to see it at any moment now.
And, Sandy, just as soon as it comes into view,
we must paddle like everything to make it.
Once we fly past, and it is all over with us!"</p>

<p>The two castaways looked at each other, and
each set his teeth with a determination to do
wonders should the occasion call for it.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose we are anywhere on a line
with the island?" asked Sandy, a new fear
taking possession of him.</p>

<p>Bob shook his head.</p>

<p>"I don't know. It is impossible to tell anything
in all this noise and confusion. But I
think so; I hope so," he replied.</p>

<p>Both now settled down to watching the watery
vista that stretched beyond. The wind
was driving the rain out there on the river,
so that at times a curtain seemed to be raised
before them, only to fade away as the rain
again held up for a brief interval.</p>

<p>Bob cast an occasional glance full of apprehension
down at the water that was coming
into the canoe. He knew that the leak must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
be growing, slowly but surely. Could they
manage to make land before the boat filled
and sank under them?</p>

<p>"There! I saw the island, I am sure!"
cried Sandy, in a ringing tone. "But the rain
has come back, and it is hidden again," he
added in disgust.</p>

<p>"Which way?" shouted Bob.</p>

<p>"Over to the right! We must be just a
little too far out!" replied Sandy.</p>

<p>"Then let us get to work! Head in toward
the shore we have left, and do your very hardest,
boy!" cried Bob.</p>

<p>Both of the lads dipped the paddles deeply.
As before, they found that it required a giant's
strength to accomplish anything worth while
when pitted against that tremendous energy
contained in the swift-moving flood.</p>

<p>Fortunately Sandy had recuperated in the
brief time he had rested from his efforts, so
that he was able to do himself credit now, when
so much depended on changing their location.</p>

<p>The bare thought of missing the friendly
island, and being carried on down that raging
torrent, possibly to meet death somewhere below,
was enough to make any one, even more
tired than Sandy, swing his blade with a vim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! we can never do it, Bob!" he gasped.</p>

<p>"Never say die! Keep at it, I tell you!
It is our only chance!" was what came back
from the other wielder of the spruce paddle.</p>

<p>The island could now be plainly seen. It did
not look so large by half as when they had seen
it on going up the river; but the more elevated
parts were standing well out of the flood. On
the upper end was a mass of accumulated
debris in the shape of stranded trees and
logs.</p>

<p>Poor Sandy looked, and a groan burst from
his lips, for he feared they would not be able
to overcome the current sufficiently to bring
their little craft close enough to that friendly
shore to enable them to land!</p>

<p>And Bob, who clung so desperately to hope,
knew that there was absolutely no chance for
them to reach a landing spot at the upper end,
even if they had wanted to mix up with all
that mass of interlocked trees.</p>

<p>He had grasped the situation in a comprehensive
way, and sized it up.</p>

<p>The island was narrow, but somewhat
lengthy. Of course the current ran like a mill-race
along the shore. But Bob knew that below,
where the two opposite tides met once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
more, there was bound to be somewhat of a
reaction. Here a little backward swirl would
be found, a sort of undertow, bearing upstream
toward the foot of the island.</p>

<p>It would only extend for a limited distance.
Once they got beyond that drawback, and there
was absolutely no hope of making land!</p>

<p>And that was the one thing he had in mind
when he sang out so encouragingly to his
weaker brother:</p>

<p>"It is our only chance!"</p>

<p>Sandy was paddling with all his nerve, but
not making a very great success of the effort.
In fact, he was so winded that he hardly knew
when he dipped his blade in the yeasty water,
or drew it quaveringly toward him.</p>

<p>Still, he was game, and would not give up
so long as he could move a hand. What little
he could do to help might not stand for much,
but every bit helped, and even in his great distress
Sandy realized this.</p>

<p>He could see his brother fighting like mad
to swerve the boat still further toward that
shore, now so very close. It did not seem possible
that Bob could be equal to the slightest
additional call upon his reserve forces.</p>

<p>Now they had actually reached the upper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
end of the island, and were commencing to
speed along its length.</p>

<p>A minute or so more, and they would know
their fate. Everything seemed to depend on
that last turn, when the canoe arrived at the
junction of the two currents, just below the
foot of the haven of safety.</p>

<p>"On the outer side&mdash;change over and help
me!" shouted Bob, knowing that the critical
moment was at hand.</p>

<p>Sandy started hastily to obey, jumping at
conclusions. But once more his nervousness
played him a scurvy trick.</p>

<p>"Oh! it is gone!" Bob heard him shriek
suddenly, and, glancing up, the elder brother
saw what had happened. The fierce sweep of
the current had snatched the paddle from Sandy's
weakened hand, and it was already floating
far beyond his reach!</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXVII<br />

<small>BOB</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> situation had suddenly grown more
desperate.</p>

<p>Deprived of what assistance Sandy might
have given him, Bob must shoulder the entire
burden. Perhaps the other had not been doing
much, but his weak efforts must surely have
helped a little.</p>

<p>Bob instinctively moved back. This would
give him greater power to swing the head of
the dancing canoe toward the objective point;
for the paddler in the stern usually commands
the course of the boat better than his comrade
placed in the bow, though the latter guards
against collisions, where rocks or stumps
abound.</p>

<p>The time was so frightfully short that whatever
was done had to be carried out by sheer
instinct, rather than reasoning.</p>

<p>Sandy, utterly exhausted, and with his poor
heart almost broken because of this new catastrophe
which could be laid to his eager clumsiness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
had dropped back in the bottom of the
canoe. Here he lay in several inches of water,
so discouraged that he was for the moment
utterly unmindful of what was going on around
him.</p>

<p>Of course he knew that Bob was working
like a frantic being to push the wavering bow
just a little closer to the shore they were so
rapidly skirting. But it was all useless. His
blunder had spoiled their last hope, and now
nothing remained but to take what came.</p>

<p>How wonderful it was to see how Bob arose
to the occasion. His arms were working like
flails in the hands of a thresher of grain. They
sped backward and forward with a momentum
that fairly bewildered the eyes of Sandy.</p>

<p>But alas! there was one stupendous drawback,
one thing that seemed fated to undo all
this splendid work which his gallant brother
was putting into play. Sandy saw, and groaned
in spirit; for that was where he might have
saved the day had he not lost his grip on his
paddle when the hungry waves snatched at it.</p>

<p>It was the lost motion that would ruin them.
Fast though Bob was making his apparently
tireless arms move, he could not keep up a
constant movement. And between his strokes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
that ceaseless current would undo nearly every
bit of good that had been accomplished by his
efforts.</p>

<p>Had Sandy been able to insert his blade between,
he might have held the canoe to what
had been gained. And each time Bob would
have won more and more inches.</p>

<p>And yet, despite this serious handicap, Bob
was actually doing wonders. Surely they did
not seem to be quite so far away from the shore
as when they first came abreast of the long
island!</p>

<p>Sandy awoke to the fact that perhaps after
all there <i>was</i> a glimmer of hope.</p>

<p>"Oh! if you only can, Bob!" he cried, bestirring
himself.</p>

<p>Was there anything he could do to help? He
thought of leaning over the side of the canoe,
and using his poor hands to dash at the water,
on whose swiftly moving bosom they were being
swept along.</p>

<p>Useless, worse than useless, for in so doing
he might only serve to weaken Bob's furious
efforts, by shaking the frail and almost sinking
boat.</p>

<p>His gun&mdash;could he not do something with
the broad shoulder butt to urge the canoe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
around? Sandy was a creature of impulse.
He seldom waited to give a second thought
to anything, once it found lodgment in his
brain.</p>

<p>So he made a swoop forward, snatching the
musket from the place where it had been fastened
before the voyage was begun. The cord
held, but with a second fierce jerk he broke it.</p>

<p>Then, with a shout in which new hope had a
part, Sandy dipped the stock of the old gun
deep in the river, and swept it around toward
the stern.</p>

<p>Bob realized what he was doing. He could
not look around, of course, since each second
was priceless just then. Perhaps he understood
from some trifling change in the movement
of the canoe, when he drew his dripping
blade out for another mad plunge, that a new
element had taken hold.</p>

<p>And it may have even spurred the brave lad
to doing better than before, if such a thing
could be.</p>

<p>They were now rapidly approaching the
lower end of the island. Bob's eyes were fastened
eagerly on that point. The rain had
ceased temporarily, and he could see plainly.
How he wished he had examined the cross currents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
there more closely at the time they were
leisurely paddling up stream!</p>

<p>There would only be time for about a dozen
more quick energetic dips of the paddle. He
must make each one tell. After that a great
deal would depend on fortune whether they
reached that line of foam which marked the
edge of the drawback. If they could only attain
a lodgment within that charmed half circle, he
believed it would be possible to gain the
land.</p>

<p>Sandy was working again with feverish anxiety
to undo the harm his mistake had wrought.</p>

<p>The newly awakened hope gave him a fictitious
strength, and, while the stock of an old
flint-lock musket may not be the finest sort of a
paddle in the world, there might be things much
worse.</p>

<p>Sandy knew they had a chance! He could
see the head of the canoe, water-logged though
the craft was at the time, and slow to respond
to their efforts, turning toward the land, inch
by inch.</p>

<p>Yes, surely they were going to make it! If
only Bob could keep up his strenuous work a
dozen seconds longer all must be well. Once
they reached the border of the cross currents,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
the tug would be relieved wonderfully, and they
could urge their unwieldy craft into a harbor!</p>

<p>He knew Bob would rise to the occasion.
He could see him settling himself as if to let
loose the very last atom of reserve strength
there might lurk in his system. Gallant Bob!
was his like ever known among the young pioneers
of the West? Nothing seemed able to
crush his hopeful and determined spirit. What
a brother to have; and how Sandy's whole soul
seemed to go out to him in that dreadful moment,
when their lives hung trembling in the
balance!</p>

<p>Trust him for keeping a tight grip on his
invaluable blade. There could never happen
to wise Bob the same disaster that had overwhelmed
Sandy with confusion.</p>

<p>Three of the needed half-dozen sweeps had
already been given. And the result seemed to
be all that might have been expected, so that
Sandy's hopes rose higher with each stroke.</p>

<p>They were gaining&mdash;they would make the
ripple, and be saved from the horrors that lay
further down that swollen stream!</p>

<p>And just when Sandy was about to burst out
into a shout of joy, if his spent breath would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
allow of such a thing, he was suddenly plunged
back again into the pit of despair.</p>

<p>For there was an ominous sharp crack, a
cry from Bob, and he held up the stump of his
broken paddle. It had failed him at the critical
moment!</p>

<p>Poor Sandy collapsed when he saw this sight.
He dropped his now useless gun in the bottom
of the canoe, and cowered there, shutting out
the terrible sight of the island slipping past by
covering his eyes with his hands.</p>

<p>It had been so nearly accomplished that the
catastrophe seemed all the more keen, and he
could not bear to look at the receding haven
which they had hoped to make their refuge.</p>

<p>Of course now the canoe would be wholly in
the power of the victorious current, which must
carry it onward like a chip, until shortly the
incoming water would attain such a level as to
sink the craft. Then&mdash;but Sandy could not
allow himself to picture what would happen
when he and his brother were forced to battle
with the cruel giants contained in those leaping
waves.</p>

<p>But what was this? Surely there was a jerking
motion to the craft that had been missing
after Bob's ill-fated paddle broke!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>Sandy wonderingly uncovered his eyes. He
stared in dismay. Why, where was Bob? The
place where he had set while working like a
hero was deserted! Had he seen the folly of
further resistance, and thrown himself over the
side, welcoming the fate that seemed so certain?</p>

<p>Sandy half started up, cold with fear. The
boat was still heading toward that end of the
island, so close that he could easily have tossed
a biscuit on the nearest bushes, half under
water now!</p>

<p>Some unseen influence was evidently urging
the canoe along its course, just as though a
friendly giant, concealed from view under the
rushing, tumultuous waters, had decided at the
last instant to give the adventurous boys a
parting chance.</p>

<p>Then all at once the truth flashed over him.
Why, to be sure, it was Bob! He had refused
to be utterly cast down by the sudden reverse
that snatched away his valuable paddle by
snapping it in half. He had instantly plunged
over the side of the boat. He was in the water,
gripping the hesitating canoe, and striving
with all his power to urge it into peaceful
waters!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>So Sandy again snatched up his abandoned
gun, and, dipping the stock deep in the river's
foam, strove to add what little assistance he
could to the gallant efforts of the boy who
would not give in.</p>

<p>Inch by inch they began to win out. Sandy's
heart seemed to be in his mouth during that
critical period, when the boat actually balanced
between two courses. Then, as though Bob had
given a last tremendous lunge, it selected the
easier alternative, and headed for the point of
the island!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII<br />

<small>A RESCUE</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Overboard</span> with you, and help!"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, Bob; I'm coming!"</p>

<p>Sandy seemed to be given a new lease of
life. Hope brought fresh powers of endurance.
Without an instant's delay he slid over the end
of the canoe, and into the flood.</p>

<p>He was a swimmer, like every young pioneer
who went into the wilderness with his people;
and, as soon as Sandy put his shoulder to the
now-lightened canoe, why of course its progress
toward the near-by point of land was considerably
quickened.</p>

<p>It was all right! They could count on being
able to make land, where the boat might be
repaired, and their own flagging energies restored,
ere they again breasted the swollen
stream in the effort to reach the home shore.</p>

<p>Now they could touch bottom with their feet.
After that it was easy; so that soon the boat
was dragged up on the land, safe from the
swirling waters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>Sandy tried to give a shout to signify how
glad he felt; but there was not breath enough
left in his lungs. All he could do was to sink
down on the friendly shore, and pant like a
winded deer.</p>

<p>Bob followed suit. He was as exhausted as
his brother; for his recent efforts had been
simply tremendous. And, as he lay on the
shore, there must have come to his heart that
warm glow so natural to victory, when one has
fought the good fight, and won.</p>

<p>But not for long did Bob stay there on the
ground. He knew that there was much to be
done, since they were soaked to the skin, and
shivering. Besides, the canoe must be emptied
of the water it contained and dragged up
higher; for no one could say to what limit the
flood might attain ere it began to fall.</p>

<p>And Sandy, seeing his intention, also
dragged his weary frame erect.</p>

<p>"What ought we do first?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Take hold, and we will empty out the
canoe. Then let us try to make some sort of
shelter from the rain; after which a fire would
be the next best thing."</p>

<p>Sandy worked hard. He was cold, and his
teeth rattled together in spite of the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
gratitude that filled his heart over their almost
miraculous preservation. The sooner they got
that campfire started, the better for them both.</p>

<p>He went to work as on the other occasion,
at the time they were preparing against the
coming of this storm. Only now he had to
accept just such substitutes as the island afforded.</p>

<p>Fortunately it was wooded, so that they need
not lack for material. Some of the rocks offered
a chance to build up side walls, over
which the roof might slope, to shed the rain
that was still coming down.</p>

<p>It took time to accomplish all this, but promised
to repay their efforts. When the shelter
was in a fair way toward being finished, Bob
set to work starting a fire. Luckily he kept
his tinder in a little waterproof box, held
within his bag; and it had not suffered from
his immersion in the river.</p>

<p>An adept with flint and steel, he quickly had
the sparks flying, and a blaze began to spring
up. This was fed with bits of dry wood, torn
from the heart of a partly-dead tree, until there
was enough fire to seize upon anything offered
in the way of fuel.</p>

<p>"How good that feels!" declared the shivering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
Sandy, holding out his hands toward the
leaping flames.</p>

<p>"I agree with you," answered Bob, smiling
just as of yore, as if the terrible events of the
last half hour were only a dream.</p>

<p>They cowered there under their shelter while
their garments steamed in the now genial heat.
With every passing minute both boys were
feeling better. Sandy even began to cast covetous
glances toward the buffalo meat, which
was lying close at hand, as though his customary
appetite had once more started to let him
know growing boys must be often fed.</p>

<p>Seeing this, Bob nodded his head. He was
feeling drowsy, for the natural reaction after
his recent tremendous exertions had set in;
and this was augmented by the delicious
warmth of the fine fire.</p>

<p>So Sandy started to find a lot of reeds that
would answer for toasting forks, on which bits
of meat could be brought to a delightful stage
when placed close to the blaze.</p>

<p>"It's stopped raining, Bob!" he declared,
as he returned after his foraging expedition
with all the reeds needed.</p>

<p>"I hope that is the end of it," declared the
other, though he poked his head out from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
shelter and surveyed the lowering heavens
doubtingly.</p>

<p>"Where do you think all this water is coming
from?" asked Sandy, looking across the
broad river to the shore where, further down,
the new settlement stood; and no doubt wondering
how they were ever going to cross that
raging flood that was carrying hundreds of
trees on its bosom.</p>

<p>"Oh, you forget that two rivers flow into
this at Fort Pitt. Besides, there are other
streams, all bank-full. It has been a terrible
rain. Never in Virginia did we ever see anything
like it."</p>

<p>"How fortunate that there are hills all
along the Ohio, where the flood cannot reach.
No wonder Colonel Boone warned us never to
build our cabins low down to the edge of the
water. Why, Bob, just think what would have
happened now had we foolishly done so!"</p>

<p>"Yes," remarked the other, as he cut off
several pieces of meat to toast at the end of the
reeds Sandy had tossed him. "After this,
perhaps some one I know will have more respect
for the simple old medicine man who
foretold just this flood. How about that,
Sandy?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>"He knew, sure enough," admitted the
other, readily; "but just as you said, I believe
he guessed what was coming from the
looks of the sky. The longer it held off the
worse it would be when it arrived. Say, this
is what I call comfort, Bob. Think what a
difference between our present condition, and
when we were fighting for our lives out yonder,"
and Sandy shuddered as he cast a quick
glance toward the spot where the two currents
clashed after skirting the length of the island.</p>

<p>After a while they were able to begin eating.
Perhaps there might have seemed a sameness
about this fare to a modern boy; but these
hardy pioneer lads never dreamed of complaining.
Indeed, their hearts were now filled with
thanksgiving over their recent miraculous escape,
and there was no room for regrets. Besides,
they were not used to luxuries in those
days.</p>

<p>Sandy was drawing a long breath, as though
really unable to finish all the food he had
cooked, when he saw his brother start up. Bob
was holding his head in a listening attitude.</p>

<p>"What did you think you heard?" exclaimed
the other, in alarm.</p>

<p>"I must have been mistaken," said Bob,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
smiling; "for it would be next to impossible
for any one to be out here on this island right
now."</p>

<p>"But did you think you heard some one
call?" persisted Sandy.</p>

<p>"Yes, it sounded like a shout. But no doubt
it was some hawk that has found shelter, like
ourselves, on the island. If we watch we will
likely see him fly away, now that the rain has
stopped."</p>

<p>Bob had hardly spoken when both brothers
half sprang to their feet.</p>

<p>"It was a cry for help!" exclaimed Sandy,
looking at his brother, as usual expecting Bob
to take the initiative in the emergency.</p>

<p>"Some one is in trouble!" said the other,
"and it is up to us to see if we can do anything
for him. Remember how we would have been
crazy with joy had there been a helping hand
held out when all seemed lost!"</p>

<p>"There it comes again! And from the same
place! Whoever it is, he cannot be going past
the island."</p>

<p>"No," cried Bob, "I think he must have
been thrown ashore among all that trash at the
upper end, and, unable to help himself, is in
danger of drowning there, caught in the piled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
up tree-tops. Come, we must get there and
lend a hand."</p>

<p>"It may be an Indian, and a hostile," reminded
Sandy.</p>

<p>"I do not think so, for the shout seemed
to call for 'help!' But even if it is an Indian,
surely you have reason for knowing that all
Indians are not cruel and merciless. Remember
the gratitude of Blue Jacket. Come,
Sandy!"</p>

<p>Bob hardly needed to say all this, for Sandy
would not have held back. Together they made
their way along the shore. It was not easy
travelling, for the bushes grew thickly and interfered
with their passage; but Bob led the
way, and, accustomed to pushing through the
woods, he surmounted all difficulties, Sandy
coming close at his heels.</p>

<p>In this fashion they finally came to the head
of the island, where the floating trunks of dead
trees, some with branches, too, formed a sort
of barrier, which the force of the flood had
swept up on the point.</p>

<p>"There, look yonder, Bob! I see him!"
cried Sandy, the instant they arrived.</p>

<p>There was indeed a clinging figure out amid
that mass of floating timber. The unknown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
seemed to be endeavoring to crawl through the
network surrounding him; but his strength
had apparently reached its last notch.</p>

<p>Bob never hesitated, but started out over
the logs. Now and then he had to exercise considerable
care lest he slip, and once more
plunge into the roaring flood.</p>

<p>"Stand where you are, Sandy," he called to
his brother, who had followed him. "Be ready
to help when I give the word. I think I can
get hold of him, and slew him around to you.
Take care, and keep your footing!"</p>

<p>Evidently Bob knew just how to carry out
his hastily-arranged plan, for in a brief time
he had gripped the unknown by the arm, and
was hauling him out of and over the wreckage
that surrounded him.</p>

<p>So by slow degrees they managed between
them all to get ashore. Here the man collapsed.
He was no doubt overcome by the joyful
sense of safety, when he had apparently
given himself up for lost.</p>

<p>"We must get him down to our little camp,"
said Bob, as he looked at the exhausted man.</p>

<p>"Who can he be!" questioned Sandy; for
the bearded white face was totally unfamiliar
to either of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do not know. Take hold of his feet, while
I try to hold his shoulders. Between us we can
carry him, step by step."</p>

<p>They had made a passage in going up, and
it would have been easier returning had they
not been burdened with the senseless stranger;
but, by resting frequently, the two boys finally
managed to attain their end, and the man was
laid alongside the fire.</p>

<p>They started to rub the hands of the sufferer,
to restore circulation, for he was evidently
chilled to the bone, as well as utterly exhausted.</p>

<p>No doubt the genial warmth of the fire had
considerable to do with it; but the efforts of
the boys counted as something, and presently
they were rewarded by seeing the man's eyes
open.</p>

<p>"He's alive, Bob! We're going to bring
him around all right!" exclaimed Sandy.</p>

<p>In five minutes the man could lie there and
hold out his trembling hands to the fire. In
ten he was sitting up, gnawing hungrily at a
piece of roasted meat Sandy had handed him,
as though he knew that in this way he would
regain some of that strength which he had lost
when engulfed in the flood.</p>

<p>And sitting there, watching him curiously,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
the two lads never once suspected how again
their lucky star was in the ascendent; and that
in saving this stranger from a watery grave
they were bringing happiness home to those
they loved so dearly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXIX<br />

<small>WONDERFUL TIDINGS</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> man was so weak that presently he sank
back and seemed to sleep.</p>

<p>"Is he going to die?" asked Sandy, alarmed
at his looks.</p>

<p>"Not just now," replied his brother, shaking
his head as he spoke. "You felt that
heat of the fire yourself; and you see it has
sent him to sleep. Here, cover him with my
blanket. It is dry now, and will keep him
warm."</p>

<p>Leaving the stranger, who as yet had not
spoken a word, the boys turned their attention
to the leaky canoe. They knew how the Indians
managed to stop any such openings in their
light boats, made of birch bark or buffalo
hides; and Bob had been wise enough to carry
along some of the necessary pitch when starting
out on this journey of exploration.</p>

<p>"Do you ever forget anything?" demanded
Sandy, when he saw his brother produce the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
needed material for mending their boat, and
start heating it over the fire.</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, often," replied Bob, cheerfully;
for he knew his own faults, even if Sandy refused
to see them. "And it was possible that
we would run on a snag that would punch a hole
in the boat; so I came prepared to mend it."</p>

<p>The boat had been carried near the fire some
time before, in order that it might dry out.
When the conditions were right Bob set to
work. He had asked Blue Jacket many questions
regarding repairing canoes, when the
young Shawanee brave was a guest under the
Armstrong roof; and what he had learned
proved of considerable value to him now.</p>

<p>"How will it hold?" asked Sandy, who was
hovering near, eager to lend a hand if his
brother needed help.</p>

<p>"I think it will be stronger than ever," came
the reply.</p>

<p>"That was always a weak spot, I remember.
Once, I thought my foot was going to break
through," declared Sandy, reminiscently.</p>

<p>"Just as you say. I noticed it myself, and
that was one mistake I made. I should have
put this patch on before we started on our
trip," and Bob stood back to survey his work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," remarked the younger lad, as his
eyes went out over that tumbling flood, on
which the trees were swiftly passing in procession,
"we will need a good stout boat if
we hope to get over there. Do you think we
can manage it, Bob? I'd be willing to take
some chances rather than stay here a week,
perhaps two, and have mother crying her eyes
out for us the while."</p>

<p>"I see no reason why we shouldn't make
it," came Bob's reply. "The current heads
toward our shore. Besides, with three to paddle,
we should be able, foot by foot, to get over.
And when we once leave the middle of the river
it will not be so bad."</p>

<p>"Three! Then you expect that our new
friend will be able to help out?" and Sandy
glanced toward the sleeping stranger.</p>

<p>"Surely. After he wakes up he will be
stronger. And he does not look like one who
would shirk. He must have struggled hard to
reach that place where we found him. Perhaps
he saw our fire through the trees, or heard
you shout. That was what made him cry
out."</p>

<p>Bob had picked up a hatchet as he spoke, and
started to move off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let me cut some more fuel," objected
Sandy, as he tried to take the tool from the
other's hands.</p>

<p>"It isn't that," said Bob. "I am going to
look for a piece of wood that can be chopped
into new paddles. We need three of them, you
see, and it is going to be a long job to fashion
them, with only a hatchet and a jackknife to
work with."</p>

<p>"Then I will go along. Perhaps two pair of
eyes may be better than one in looking for the
spruce pine," declared the younger brother, eagerly.</p>

<p>And so it proved, for Sandy was the one to
discover the tree they sought. Bob could figure
just how the paddles might be hewn out, and he
attacked the tree in a spirited way that soon
encompassed its fall.</p>

<p>When he tired, Sandy took a turn; and in
this fashion they finally had three pieces, in
the rough, which Bob declared would make
very good paddles. And by slow degrees the
first one was shaped until it only needed whittling
with a knife to complete the job.</p>

<p>"That seems all right," declared Sandy, as
he proceeded to try the blade; "and I give
you my word that it is far stronger than either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
of the ones we lost. I mean to fasten my paddle,
this time, to my wrist with a bit of buckskin
thong, and then, even if I lose my grip,
it will never get away."</p>

<p>"A clever idea," answered Bob, pausing in
his work to wipe his brow, and smile at his
brother; "and it will pay us all to do the
same. Was it not father who told us how an
ounce of prevention is better than a pound of
cure? And once a paddle gets caught in the
clutch of that river it can never be recovered
again."</p>

<p>"See!" exclaimed Sandy, "our friend is
stirring! He is sitting up, and staring around
him. I think he can hardly understand where
he is, and how he came to cheat the river of
a grave. Now he sees us, and smiles. Bob,
there is something I like about that man,
stranger though he is. I seem to feel that he
is a friend, and that we will always be glad
we rescued him to-day."</p>

<p>"I am sure of that. There, the second paddle
is about done. I am tired of the work, so
let us go over to make the acquaintance of
our guest. He is beckoning to us," and
Bob dropped his hatchet to obey the summons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>The stranger held out both hands, while his
bearded face lighted up with a smile that, as
Sandy had said, was very winning.</p>

<p>"How can I ever thank you, boys, for what
you have done?" he said, as he pressed a hand
of each. "But for you I should have passed
over to the other side."</p>

<p>"Please do not say anything more," replied
Bob, who could not bear to be praised for simply
doing his duty. "Who may you be, and
how did it happen that we found you among
the tree-tops at the head of this island?"</p>

<p>"My name is Silas Hemphill. With a party
of others I was on my way down the river in
a dugout canoe, intending to join our fortunes
with the new settlers from Virginia, who lately
came overland. We left Fort Pitt two days
back, and were progressing fairly when this
storm broke upon us. Doubtless we took too
many chances, for we presently found ourselves
in the grasp of the river, and could not
return to shore."</p>

<p>He paused a minute to get a grip on himself,
and then continued:</p>

<p>"Finally our boat was overturned. Heaven
alone knows what became of my two companions;
but I fear they must have been drowned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
Only by the rarest of good fortune, and the
favor of Providence, was I able to keep afloat
until cast up amid the tree-tops where you
found me."</p>

<p>"But why did you shout? Surely you could
not imagine that any one would be on this
island to hear you?" asked Sandy, curious
still.</p>

<p>"I did not know then it was an island. And
it seemed to me that I had heard a voice calling,
which I supposed must belong to one of
my friends who had luckily gained a footing
on the shore. That was why I cried out, for
I was frantic. But I fear much that I am the
only survivor of the three voyagers."</p>

<p>The newcomer was eying them in turn curiously.</p>

<p>"And now," he said, "I would like to know
your names; for I shall never forget what I
owe you both. I can see that you must be
brothers, for there is some resemblance between
you; though I should say that this one,"
indicating Sandy, "probably takes after his
mother; while the other is more like his father.
This without knowing who your parents may
be."</p>

<p>"My name is Alexander, though they always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
call me Sandy. We are the sons of David and
Mary Armstrong."</p>

<p>As Sandy spoke Silas Hemphill's eyes took
on a new glow, and again he thrust out both
hands to seize those of the boys.</p>

<p>"How wonderful are the ways of Providence!"
he muttered, in a way that gave the
listening boys a start. "To think that my life
should have been saved by the sons of David
Armstrong, of all men!"</p>

<p>"Then you know our father?" demanded
Bob.</p>

<p>"No, I have never met him," came the reply.
"But I have heard much about him in
the country I happened to pass through while
on my way here from Carolina, where my
former home lay."</p>

<p>The rescued man looked at them both, and
Bob was thrilled to see tears in his eyes. Why
should this stranger be so moved at sight of
David Armstrong's two boys? He spoke of
having heard about their father&mdash;could that
have been down in Virginia, in the town which
had been so cruel to the man who valued his
honor as he did his very life?</p>

<p>Bob saw a faint gleam of light. He hardly
dared believe it at first, in fear lest it prove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
only a hollow mockery. Still, he could not resist
saying:</p>

<p>"You say you heard much about our father,
sir,&mdash;was it to his credit that these things
were said; or did they tell you the hateful, lying
stories that drove him to come far away
from those who were once his neighbors and
friends?"</p>

<p>"My boy, I heard that which your father
would give much to know. While I stopped for
a few days in the town where you dwelt, there
was a serious fray in a place where strong
drink was sold. One man, a black, was badly
wounded. His name was Scipio, Black Scipio
he was called, and he used to work in the same
tobacco warehouse where David Armstrong
was employed. Before he died the man confessed
that it was <i>his</i> hand that fired the barn,
for the destruction of which your father was
blamed. And now Jason Diggett, conscience
stricken for having driven an honest man into
exile, wishes to hear from your father in order
that he make amends, in so far as pounds, shillings
and pence may heal the wound!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX<br />

<small>CONCLUSION</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a full minute the two lads just sat there
and stared at each other. Neither could say
a single word; indeed, they did not seem to
even breathe, such was the excess of sheer happiness
that passed over them like a great
wave.</p>

<p>Their father's innocence then was proved!
His old-time neighbors knew now how grievously
they had wronged the one whose name
had never before been smirched with a suspicion
of evil doing!</p>

<p>Suddenly Sandy awoke. He sprang up and
began to dance wildly about, while he flung his
arms above his head and shouted at the top
of his strong, boyish voice.</p>

<p>"It's come at last, Bob! Just think of it!
Father is able to look any man in the face now!
Hurrah! it was worth all it cost to learn this!
Yes, and I'd go through it again if I had to.
Thank you, Mr. Hemphill, thank you! You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
will find a happy family when you go home
with us, and a warm welcome there!"</p>

<p>The stranded man looked out over that tumbling
sea, and shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Do we have to take the chances of crossing
that swollen stream?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bob; "but we have mended
our boat, and will have three strong new paddles
to work with. We could stay here until
to-morrow, but I fear the river may be even
worse then than now. But you have made us
both happy. We feel that nothing ought to
keep us from reaching home this day, to carry
the blessed news to our dear ones!"</p>

<p>Bob started back at his work with feverish
eagerness; but now joy filled his soul, and
caused him to chop with new zeal.</p>

<p>The third paddle was hewn out even while
Sandy was smoothing off the second with his
jackknife, he being a master-hand at such work,
as many boys were in the days when few
amusements were given them.</p>

<p>It was now about the middle of the afternoon.
The sky was still gloomy overhead, and
Bob had fears that the rain would set in
again.</p>

<p>"Another reason why we ought to try to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
cross before darkness comes," he said, when
they spoke about this.</p>

<p>"I only hope it does not start when we are
out on that flood," answered Sandy, with a
shiver.</p>

<p>"That would be a misfortune," declared
Silas Hemphill. "Surely we will not be deserted
in the eleventh hour. I hope to shake
David Armstrong's hand to-night."</p>

<p>Sandy hurried the finishing of the third paddle.
He did not relish the voyage they had
before them; but there seemed no other course
open.</p>

<p>Before starting out they made all things as
secure as possible. Hemphill had by this time
fully recovered and professed himself not only
willing, but able, to do his share of the paddling.
The canoe would carry three, though
one might find it necessary at times to stop paddling
in order to bale out what water dashed
over the sides.</p>

<p>Bob had taken as good a view as possible
of their expected course. As he could not see
a great distance down the river he might only
surmise what awaited them there.</p>

<p>Of course the one prime necessity was to
make as quickly as they could toward shore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
taking advantage of every eddy to gain a few
inches or feet at a time.</p>

<p>"I believe I have learned something from
our past experience," he remarked, as he took
his place in the stern, ready to push off.</p>

<p>Sandy occupied the bow, while Silas Hemphill
was a fixture in the centre, where he could
assist with his blade, or dip water over the
side, as occasion arose.</p>

<p>"Ready?" asked Bob, trying to appear
quite at his ease, though doubtless his heart
was thumping at a tremendous rate at the prospect
of their once more daring the dangers of
the flood.</p>

<p>"Yes, push off, Bob!" said Sandy, wonderfully
grave, for him.</p>

<p>Truth to tell there was no doubt but that
every one of them just then was occupied with
secretly praying that success might attend
their object, and the friendly shore be attained
in safety.</p>

<p>"Here goes, then!"</p>

<p>With the words Bob gave a shove, and the
canoe once more danced upon the swollen waters
of the furious Ohio.</p>

<p>Immediately every paddle was set to work.
The boat made a good start, and shot away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
from the lower end of the island like a thing
of life, heading for the southern bank of the
river.</p>

<p>Then came that strong current, and seized
hold. The paddles rose and fell, fast and
faster. Muscles were brought to bear that
dipped the blades deeply below the surface,
and, despite the sweep of the tide, they kept
continually edging nearer and nearer the goal
for which they were aiming.</p>

<p>There was a deep satisfaction in this. It
spurred them all on to doing better things.
When a wave slopped over the side Silas Hemphill
needed no reminder to tell him his duty, but,
picking up the little cooking kettle, he started
to relieve the canoe of its burden of water.</p>

<p>No one said a word. There was scant breath
for the work that occupied their attention, not
to mention talking. Actions must take the
place of conversation at such a time.</p>

<p>All the while Bob knew that they were gaining.
The shore for a brief space of time stood
out more positively than before. True, it was
beginning to rain, and coming down harder and
harder with each passing moment; but even
this could not wholly cast a damper over his
satisfaction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>"Keep going! All is well!"</p>

<p>He managed to shout these few words, feeling
that Sandy might be in need of encouragement.</p>

<p>Just where they might be no one could even
give a guess now. It was a fight in the dark,
apparently; but it could not last much longer.</p>

<p>Already had Bob noticed with joy that the
"pull" of the current was slackening considerably.
There could be but one reason for that&mdash;the
shore was close by, and here the swollen
river moved with far less impetuosity than out
in the middle.</p>

<p>At times it had been difficult to wholly avoid
a collision with some of the floating trees; but
these never varied in their steady downward
progress, and the canoe was capable of veering
out of the way, so that thus far they had succeeded
in keeping trouble at bay.</p>

<p>"Only a little more, Sandy!" called Bob.</p>

<p>Silas Hemphill again had his paddle working,
and all together they sent the boat flying
to the shore. But not one of them was able to
raise a cheer when finally they ran aground.</p>

<p>They lay there in the canoe for a short time,
limp and exhausted, satisfied to know that they
were at last safely landed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>It was Sandy's quick eyes that suddenly
made a discovery.</p>

<p>"Look! where we have come to land, Bob!"
he exclaimed, pointing to some bulky object
that seemed to be fastened to the shore with
ropes.</p>

<p>"Why!" cried Bob, also taken aback, "as
sure as anything that must be Captain Heally's
new flatboat, on which he expects some day to
drift further down the Ohio! What luck, Mr.
Hemphill! Just to think that we have landed
in front of <i>home!</i>"</p>

<p>They made haste to scramble ashore, after
which the canoe was carried up out of reach of
the hungry tide. By this time several men,
who had been watching to see that the ropes
holding the flatboat did not give way, had heard
them, and came hastening to the spot.</p>

<p>Shouldering the buffalo meat which had been
safely carried through all their adventures,
and with their guns and new paddles, the boys
started up the hill, eager to reassure those dear
ones, who must certainly be worrying concerning
their safety.</p>

<p>Kate was the first to sight them. The girl
had been to the lookout when the rain held up,
hoping to get some glimpse of the boat, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
no one believed it could cross the river in all
that angry storm. She had returned to the
cabin when once more the rain came down, but
was sitting at a door looking forth when,
through the mists, she caught sight of them.</p>

<p>Presently the boys and their guest were inside
the cabin, where a warm welcome awaited
them. Sandy of course could not keep back the
good news.</p>

<p>"Father!" he cried, drawing the stranger
forward, "this is Mr. Silas Hemphill, and he
brings you great joy. Coming from our old
home, he tells us the barn-burner has been
found, and confessed his crime! And who do
you think it was, but that good-for-nothing
slave, Black Scipio, owned by Jason Diggett
himself, and who wanted to even the score after
receiving twenty lashes at the hands of his
master!"</p>

<p>David Armstrong's strong face paled. Words
failed him in that supreme moment of happiness.
He could only turn his mute eyes toward
his wife, who in turn bent her head; and the
boys knew she was giving thanks to the great
God on high, because her faith had not been
in vain.</p>

<p>It was a happy household that gathered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
under the Armstrong roof that night. Wild
though the winds howled across the waste of
waters, furious as the flood swept past, inside
their walls all was serene.</p>

<p>Again and again did the newcomer have to
tell his story. It seemed as though none of
them could ever hear it often enough. And,
tired though both boys must have been after
their hard experiences of that day, neither
would think of going to bed until a late hour.</p>

<p>On the morrow a happy event took place, for
both companions of Silas Hemphill made their
appearance. They had fortunately kept together,
and, being carried near a tree, managed
to scramble into the branches. Some miles
down the stream the tree was stranded near
the shore, after getting in an eddy; and by
great good luck they landed, to make their way
to the settlement.</p>

<p>David Armstrong thought little of returning
to his old Virginia home, even though his name
had been cleared. This new country looked
far too good to him to give it up, and, besides,
there were too many bitter memories connected
with the Virginia town.</p>

<p>In good time the repentant Jason Diggett
did send out quite a bountiful supply of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
things as he fancied the new settlers might
need. David at first was inclined to refuse, but
finally accepted the gift as in some sort an
acknowledgment of reparation for the wrong
done him. What the little family did not need
he could readily barter with the Indians in his
new trade relations, receiving in return valuable
skins that he could exchange for money or
for tea, sugar and such necessities.</p>

<p>Occasionally Bob and Sandy saw their red
friend, Blue Jacket; but he was chary about
coming to the settlement, not having any great
liking for the whites except the Armstrong
family.</p>

<p>The two young pioneers considered that they
had well nigh exhausted the stock of adventures
that were to fall to their portion when
they rescued Silas Hemphill from the flood, and
carried him across the raging river to bring
good news to the Armstrong cabin.</p>

<p>Little did they suspect that still more strenuous
events were going to befall them later on
that same season, when their little sister Kate
was carried off a prisoner by the roving Iroquois.
But these adventures must be kept for
the next story of this series of frontier adventure,
to be called: "The Pioneer Boys on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
Great Lakes; or, On the Trail of the Iroquois."</p>

<p>The new settlement waxed strong in numbers,
as more people came out from the far
country beyond the range of mountains, and
joined their forces with those who were first
on the ground. A blockhouse was soon finished,
in which the settlers could find refuge
in case of an Indian attack. Fields were
planted as fast as the forest was cleared; and
before Fall arrived it was one of the most thriving
places west of Fort Pitt.</p>

<p>Daniel Boone came again, and with him that
fine fellow, Simon Kenton; just then starting
out on his adventurous career, and destined to
become so famous in the annals of border warfare.
In him the brave and warlike red men
found a fearless enemy, equal to Boone himself,
and one ready to dare any peril in defence of
the hardy settlers.</p>

<p>As the summer waxed and waned Bob and
Sandy Armstrong went about their business of
providing the family with fresh meat, for game
laws were unknown in those early days, and
working men must have food to sustain their
strength.</p>

<p>While there were occasional times when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
Shawanees swooped down upon the border settlements,
they somehow seemed to leave this
peaceful home community alone. And David
Armstrong and his friends understood that this
immunity was the result of the time when Bob
and Sandy took the wounded brave in charge,
and saved his life. Blue Jacket guarded their
interests; and the whole community profited
from the charge.</p>

<h2>NOTES</h2>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Note_1"></a>Note 1 (<a href="#Page_1">page 1</a>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> the people of the frontier it was customary,
when fortune was kind, so that they happened to
possess an overabundance of fresh venison, to dry a
stock of this meat for the lean time when food would
be scarce. This was known as dried or "jerked"
venison, and could be nibbled at when on a tramp, or
else served in the form of a stew, being fairly palatable.
Of course they picked up this habit of laying in a store
against a time of necessity from the Indians, who had
possibly done this same thing through the centuries
of the past, long before the new America became
known to the people of the Old World.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Note_2"></a>Note 2 (<a href="#Page_10">page 10</a>)</span></h3>

<p>The deer which had fallen to the guns of Bob and
Sandy was of the common red Virginia species. This
animal has always been found east of the Mississippi,
and ranging from the Great Lakes down to the tip
end of the Florida peninsula. The farther south one
goes, the smaller the deer becomes; so that it is not
uncommon for a successful hunter among the palmetto-bordered
shores of the Mexican Gulf to carry his quarry
home on his back, with little effort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Note_3"></a>Note 3 (<a href="#Page_32">page 32</a>)</span></h3>

<p>The usual costume of the day consisted of a heavy
jacket and trousers, and under the jacket a sort of
jerkin or close waistcoat made of wool. Underneath
this was another garment that might perhaps be called
a shirt, woven in the crude, home-made hand loom,
and adding much to the comfort of the wearer.</p>

<p>Except for the woollen jerkin, all the clothing was
made of a stout cloth that in later days came to be
known as jeans. It was wear-resisting to a remarkable
degree, which of course proved to be a blessing all
around, for new clothes in the families of most pioneers
must always be an event never to be forgotten in the
lives of the children.</p>

<p>Moccasins usually covered the feet, shoes being
expensive luxuries which few among the settlers could
afford. To tan a deerskin, and fashion a pair of moccasins,
was an accomplishment quickly learned from
the Indians.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Note_4"></a>Note 4 (<a href="#Page_55">page 55</a>)</span></h3>

<p>Perhaps to the boy of to-day the Armstrong home
would have appeared a very cheerless place. The
sleeping-places in the loft were reached by means of a
pair of steep stairs that when not in use could be drawn
up to the board ceiling, thus affording more room below.
Over in one corner stood the spinning-wheel which was
responsible for so many of Bob and Sandy's comforts
in the way of clothes. In another quarter was the
loom at which the good woman of the house was wont
to fashion the stout cloth from which the outer garments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
of both boys, as well as Mr. Armstrong himself,
were made.</p>

<p>Under the small window stood the locker in which
the housewife kept what small remnant of former
luxuries in the way of linen remained to her from the
stores in the comfortable home in Richmond that had
been theirs before trouble found them out.</p>

<p>The light from the open windows fell upon the
bunches of herbs and dried vegetables that hung from
the low rafters overhead, and upon the steaming pot
that hung over the blaze in the wide-throated fireplace.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Note_5"></a>Note 5 (<a href="#Page_112">page 112</a>)</span></h3>

<p>Daniel Boone at this time was still a comparatively
young man; but already his intrepid soul had drank
deeply of the cup of adventure; and he felt within him
the yearning of a true explorer.</p>

<p>He had, some years before, given up his comfortable
home in the Yadkin valley, away back in North Carolina,
because the country there was becoming "too
thickly settled" to please his ideas of comfort. When
it became necessary to mark the boundaries of his
fields, and he could actually see the smoke of another
cabin not over half a mile away, he resolved to put
into action the designs for a westward move which in
secret he had long been cherishing.</p>

<p>His faithful wife gave herself heart and soul to his
ambition to settle in that mysterious Golden West
that seemed to be beckoning Boone on. They made a
first step by crossing the Cumberland Mountains,
and starting a new home to the west of this range.</p>

<p>But Boone had already been further in Kentucky,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
and there was that in the rich plains of the interior
to draw him like a magnet. When one has seen the
region long known as the "Blue Grass country,"
around Lexington, and realized what a paradise on
earth it has ever been, it is not so hard to understand
why Daniel Boone refused to content himself with a
home in a safer locality, less favored by Nature.</p>

<p>In history Boone will always stand at the head of
the brave pioneers who opened up the grand country
south of the Ohio. All his later life he was engaged in
trying to defend the infant settlements against the
assaults of the red men. These Indians learned to
respect him as a man more than any other "paleface"
known to the times.</p>

<p>Kentucky was known for many years as the "debatable
ground," simply because of the tremendous
efforts of the Shawanees, allied with other Indian
tribes, to burn the new settlements, and drive out the
pioneers. But by slow degrees they found themselves
obliged to sue for peace, and cede their glorious lands
to their conquerors in exchange for certain valuable
commodities.</p>

<p>To show what this remarkable man endured for
the sake of the principle which he had made a part of
his life, his own words, when speaking of Kentucky,
may be given as evidence of his sincerity of purpose:</p>

<p>"My footsteps have often been marked by blood,
and therefore I can truly subscribe to its title of the
'dark and bloody ground.' Two darling sons and a
brother have I lost by savage hands. Many dark and
sleepless nights have I been a companion for owls,
separated from the cheerful society of men, scorched
by the summer's sun, and pinched by the winter's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
cold&mdash;an instrument ordained to settle the wilderness.
But now the scene is changed; peace crowns the sylvan
shade!"</p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Note_6"></a>Note 6 (<a href="#Page_113">page 113</a>)</span></h3>

<p>Simon Kenton was very young at this time; but
already in Boone he seems to have found the type of
man whom he aspired to imitate. Brave to a stage of
rashness, he lacked many of the most admirable qualities
that stamped that peerless pioneer, but he had
a personality that inspired the respect and admiration
of all.</p>

<p>Kenton's association with Boone in those early
days had a great influence on his future life. His one
failing was rashness; and, when dealing with a sly
and treacherous foe, such as the red men invariably
proved themselves to be, this was indeed a weakness
that if not corrected would sooner or later have brought
about the death of the venturesome frontiersman.</p>

<p>Boone frequently took his younger companion to
task for hasty words, or reckless conduct; and it was
due to his wise counsel and example that Kenton became
later a leader among the pioneers second only
in influence and ability to Boone himself.</p>
